"Using Vernacular Analysis to Enhance Women’s Participation in Local, Regional and National Peacebuilding Processes in Nigeria",,"This project aims to enhance women's participation, leadership, and representation in dialogues and discussions regarding security and peace in Nigeria. In an era marked by decline in the responsiveness of governments to the needs of society, devastating climate change incidents, and violent conflict, there is an urgent need to enhance the capacity of women to respond to these problems in ways that reflect their interests at all levels of society.  As the UN Sustainable Development Goals, Resolution 1325, and Nigeria and the United Kingdom’s  national women, security and peace agenda, in theory, emphasise the importance of women in development, security, peace, and conflict resolution, the question of opportunities and capacity building remains a major policy issue. How can Nigerian women’s participation in discussions, dialogues, leadership, and representation in decisions on security, peace, conflict resolution be enhanced?  Our project is intended to respond to this question on a vernacular analysis based on a theory of change that suggests more involvement of women in peacebuilding processes if they are supported with capacity building and learning opportunities.

In recent years, violent conflict and insecurity have increased across states and communities in Nigeria. Banditry, kidnapping, cultism, armed robbery, indigenous-settler disputes, intra- and intergroup conflicts, and farmer-herder conflicts occur to varying degrees across the country. Women are disproportionately impacted by these violent acts.  Too frequently, women are excluded from decisions regarding the prevention and management of such conflicts.  While women are present in the peacebuilding work of non-governmental organizations, cultural and government institutions continue to marginalize them on patriarchal grounds",628821,,,"Bid Submission",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",2,2023-12-01,2025-03-31,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"FOREIGN & COMMONWEALTH OFFICE","FOREIGN & COMMONWEALTH OFFICE Default Scheme","UK Central Government","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"Funding to support women’s participation in local, regional and national peace processes",,https://www.gov.uk/international-development-funding/funding-to-support-womens-participation-in-local-regional-and-national-peace-processes?utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=govuk-notifications-topic&utm_source=92723230-c491-4140-872d-8985622537fd&utm_content=daily#overview,,"2023-10-20 17:00",850000.00,,,,,,"Zainab Mai-Bornu (ZMB2)","Diane Levine (DTL6)","Andrew Morden (AWM22)","Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,"Partner not Listed",,,"SS/HP: Politics & International Relation","SS/CR: Criminology","SS/CR: Criminology,SS/HP: Politics & International Relation","SS/HP: Politics & International Relation","SS/CR: Criminology","SS/CR: Criminology,SS/HP: Politics & International Relation",,,,,,"99 - Not Applicable for Institute reporting",,"Ellen Puurman (EP258)",,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Politics & international studies",,,,,,,"2023-10-17 15:23",,,,,,1.,,754440.71,,754745.43,,754440.71,-304.72,99.96,167058.71,22.14,85195.93,11.29,587382.00,754440.71,0.00,754440.71,0.00,754440.71,587382.00,437382.00,437382.00,754440.71,0.00,754440.71,0.00,754440.71,437382.00,0.00,0.00,100345.68,81862.78,8482.91,0.00,67017.75,0.00,593440.71,,593745.43,,593440.71,,-304.72,99.95,156058.71,26.3,74195.93,12.5,"2023-10-19 16:43:44",,Discoverable,,"2023-10-06 17:33:44","Zainab Mai-Bornu (ZMB2)","2023-10-19 16:43"

"Time-resolved Electron Diffraction of metal redox enzyme crystals",,"We propose to develop methods collect single images (stills) from many micro crystals that can be added to make full datasets. By scanning the electron beam over the grid and continuously collecting the frames, we can select those with diffraction for inclusion, similar to how crystal jets are used at XFELs. Almost zero dose data. This technique offers the potential to react micro crystal suspensions (which will have very short diffusion path) and cryo-trap short-lived states on the enzyme reaction pathway by using a device analogue to a the continuous-flow enzymology apparatus and projecting onto the grid before plunging into a cryo-bath.

"Hyperglycaemia contributes to hypertension by altering vascular contractility and promoting vascular remodelling",,"Coexistence of diabetes and hypertension exacerbates morbidity of cardiovascular diseases, indicating a
synergy/cooperativity between these pathophysiologies. Although multifactorial, hypertension is associated
with over-production of vasoconstrictors that mediate arterial hyper-constriction, and remodelling via their
cognate G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Under normoglycaemic conditions vessel hyper-contractility is
prevented by G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2)-mediated desensitization of vasoconstrictor-GPCR
activity. Our preliminary data show that acute hyperglycaemia blocks desensitization of vasoconstrictor-
stimulated vessel contractions, prevents vasoconstrictor-mediated membrane recruitment of GPCR-
desensitizing GRK2, and enhances signalling pathways that mediate vasoconstrictor-stimulated vascular
remodelling, suggesting glucose can modulate blood pressure. We will now determine: (1) how glucose
prevents the desensitization of vasoconstrictor-stimulated vascular contractions; (2) how glucose blocks
agonist-mediated GRK2 recruitment to vasoconstrictor GPCRs; (3) how glucose effects vasoconstrictor-driven
MAPK signalling; (4) and whether these changes underlie an ability of glucose to promote VSMC
migration/proliferation. This novel work will provide greater insight into how glucose promotes hypertension.",634991,,,"Bid Development",,Pending,"Jonathon Willets (JMW23),Pre-award Admin",3,2024-07-01,2027-06-30,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"BHF British Heart Foundation","BRITISH HEART Default Scheme","UK Charities (Open Competition & External Peer Review)","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,None,,None,,,350000.00,,,,,,"Jonathon Willets (JMW23)",,,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,,"University of Liverpool",,"LS: Molecular & Cell Biology",,"LS: Molecular & Cell Biology","LS: Molecular & Cell Biology",,"LS: Molecular & Cell Biology",,,,,,,,,,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,180101.67,,409743.25,,180101.67,-229641.58,43.95,-669.58,-0.37,-669.58,-0.37,180101.67,180101.67,0.00,180101.67,0.00,180101.67,180771.25,180771.25,180101.67,180101.67,0.00,180101.67,0.00,180101.67,1500.00,0.00,0.00,58770.00,0.00,52443.00,6327.00,170202.00,0.00,180101.67,,409743.25,,180101.67,,-229641.58,43.95,-669.58,-0.37,-669.58,-0.37,"2023-10-19 14:59:12",,Private,,"2023-10-19 14:46:43","Jonathon Willets (JMW23)","2023-10-19 15:08"

"Under The Radar: The East Midlands, The Manorial Court Rolls And The Revolt Of 1381",,"Whether looking at how rumour spread of uprisings, pardoning of rebels, or the more general popular participation, over the last two decades the events of 1381 have reawakened the interest of historians. However, there is still a strong tendency to accept geographical and temporal boundaries (south east, East Anglia, etc) set early in the modern study of the revolt, if not by the surviving chronicles themselves. This project examines the value of widening out both aspects of the revolt, looking at the East Midlands, an area from which there is much anecdotal evidence but limited hard empirical research, looking to a wider time frame (1360-1400) around the revolt than the usual focus on the  years immediately after the 1381 revolt (i.e. to understand background restiveness), and conducting  a statistical analysis of the little used, for the study of the revolt at least, manorial records when it comes to local restiveness.",619694,,,"Bid Approval",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",2,2024-07-01,2026-06-30,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"BRITISH ACADEMY The British Academy","BA/Leverhulme Small Research Grants","Research Councils (BEIS) - Roy Society and Brit Academy","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"British Academy/Leverhulme Small Grants",,https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/funding/ba-leverhulme-small-research-grants/,,"2023-11-08 16:10",10000.00,,,,,,"James Bothwell (JSB16)",,,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,,,,"SS/HP: History",,"SS/HP: History","SS/HP: History",,"SS/HP: History",,,,,,"99 - Not Applicable for Institute reporting",,"Ellen Puurman (EP258)",,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,History,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7667.59,,7667.59,,7667.59,0.00,100,0.00,0,0.00,0,7667.59,7667.59,0.00,7667.59,0.00,7667.59,7667.59,7667.59,7667.59,7667.59,0.00,7667.59,0.00,7667.59,7667.59,500.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,7667.59,,7667.59,,7667.59,,0.00,100,0.00,0,0.00,0,"2023-10-19 13:50:18",,Discoverable,,"2023-09-20 16:04:45","James Bothwell (JSB16)","2023-10-19 13:50"

"Exploring the usefulness of online patient portals for the management of kidney disease: patient and health professionals' views and experiences",,"In this fellowship I will explore perceptions of online portals in kidney disease management. My aim is to evaluate these online portals and what affects usage and engagement of patients and healthcare professionals, resulting in recommendations to improve accessibility and kidney disease management for both groups.

The long-term management of kidney disease can be a challenging journey for patients and their healthcare professionals (HCPs), who often have to coordinate the management of symptoms, medication changes, comorbidities, and kidney disease progression to ensure holistic care. Online patient portals have been deployed with increasing reliance as a means of centralising this coordination, allowing those living with kidney disease and their HCPs to exchange information critical to disease management (e.g. blood test results, symptom tracking, medication changes) at a single online location (Irizarry et al., 2015).
 
Online portals designed to promote kidney disease self management, such as Patient View (PV) which has been superseded by Patient Knows Best (PKB) (UKKA, 2023) are widely used in UK kidney units to support kidney disease management. Other services use their own software or the NHS app which is used across conditions but is more restricted in terms of patient input due to patients not being able to add information directly (NHS, 2023). While such portals provide valuable support for disease management (Ancker et al., 2015a), widespread reliance on online portals may inherently disadvantage those who may be unable to access technology or who have low levels of digital literacy. User interfaces of portals may also unintentionally disengage segments of the population through flaws in usability. It is not known whether use of online portals impact how HCPs deliver care to people with kidney disease. Taken together, unless systematically addressed, these factors may propagate inequities in kidney disease management.
 
This Fellowship aims to define how the ongoing digitalisation of patient care through online portals may impact on shared management of kidney disease.
 
Objectives
 
Use descriptive survey methods to identify potential inequities in the usage of online portals 

Explore use and impact of online portals with people with kidney disease and kidney health professionals via in depth interviews
 
Produce a white paper detailing ways in which online portals might be improved to support the self management of kidney disease 
 
Three work packages are proposed to meet these objectives:
 
WP1: a descriptive quantitative study of uptake of online patient portal systems implemented in the West Yorkshire region, and among those with rare renal diseases across the UK, to provide an overview of how a sub-sample of the UK-kidney disease population currently use online portals. These data will be used to build a regression model to predict engagement.
 
WP2: an in-depth exploration of the views and experiences of people with kidney disease who use online patient portals using process evaluation (Moore, 2015) and qualitative methodology (Braun & Clarke, 2013), as well as exploring the views of those who have opted not to use or have stopped using portals.
 
WP3: in-depth interviews with kidney HCPs on views of online patient portals, their utility in supporting kidney disease management, and their role in their practise of managing kidney disease.
 
This fellowship is supported by the UK Kidney Med-Tech committee, and will represent a national collaboration between the Universities of Leicester, Nottingham Trent, Brunel University London, University College London (UCL) and University Hospital of Leicester, Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust, South Tees Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, and patient involvement leads.
 
All work packages will recruit nationally to reduce regional bias, with sample sizes informed by Fugard & Potts (2015). This work will allow tangible proposals for improvements to the online portals, to improve their usability and minimise their risk of propagating inequities, which will also be informed by the NASSS framework (Greenhalgh & Abimbola, 2019). Results of these studies will inform development of a white paper outlining how digital patient support tools for kidney disease should be implemented, taking into consideration patient and HCP views on usability, risks and impact on delivery of care. Accessible resources, including patient-facing communication, will be developed dependent on patient and HCP needs identified during analysis.",622302,,,"Bid Approval",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",3,2024-04-01,2027-03-31,,"RF - Research Fellowship",Research,,"KIDNEY RESEARCH UK Kidney Research UK","KIDNEY RESEARCH UK Default Scheme","UK Charities (Open Competition & External Peer Review)","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"Intermediate Non-Clinical Fellowship",,https://www.kidneyresearchuk.org/research/research-grants/fellowships-and-phd-studentships/,https://www.kidneyresearchuk.org/research/research-grants/fellowships-and-phd-studentships/,"2023-11-01 17:00",,,,,,,"Kristina Newman (KLN12)","Jonathan Barratt (JB81)",,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,"Brunel University London,Nottingham Trent University,Partner not Listed,South Tees Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust,University College London,University Hospitals of Leicester,University of Leeds",,,,"LS: Cardiovascular Sciences",,"LS: Cardiovascular Sciences","LS: Cardiovascular Sciences",,"LS: Cardiovascular Sciences",,,,,,"99 - Not Applicable for Institute reporting","UNITED KINGDOM","Kerry Warner (KW153)",,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Not Applicable for HEBCI","Not applicable for HEBCI",,,,,,,,,,174195.00,,320925.96,,174195.00,-146730.96,54.28,-482.49,-0.28,-6562.55,-3.77,174195.00,174195.00,0.00,174195.00,0.00,174195.00,174677.49,174677.49,174195.00,174195.00,0.00,174195.00,0.00,174195.00,45000.00,0.00,0.00,42056.94,6080.06,32103.72,3873.16,104191.53,0.00,174195.00,,320925.96,,174195.00,,-146730.96,54.28,-482.49,-0.28,-6562.55,-3.77,"2023-10-19 11:50:50",,Discoverable,,"2023-09-26 15:21:59","Kristina Newman (KLN12)","2023-10-19 15:49"

"The Radical Eco-poetics of W. H. Hudson",,"Critical engagement with the work of the Anglo-Argentine writer and naturalist W. H. Hudson (1841-1922) has never been more urgent. Hudson’s concern with environmental destruction and extinction, his immersion in South American Indigenous epistemologies, and committed belief in multispecies communities align with much twenty-first century environmental and posthuman thinking.

"Assessing the effectiveness of unidade de pronto atendimento (UPA), pediatric hospitals, and maternity hospitals in reducing the risk of COVID-19 related death and hospital-acquired COVID-19",,"The recent COVID-19 pandemic brought unprecedented challenges to health management. Some lessons have been learned so special measures may be taken in the future to reduce the risk of death and hospital infection, such as prioritizing the use of specialized hospitals and unidade de pronto atendimento (UPAs). Against this background, this project aims to assess the performance of (i) pediatric hospitals, (ii) maternity hospitals, and (iii) UPA compared to the general hospitals in treating patients with COVID-19 and infection control of COVID-19. These are assessed by considering whether patients admitted to pediatric and maternity hospitals, and UPA were associated with a higher risk of in-hospital mortality and nosocomial infection. Patient data gathered from two nationwide hospital databases are analysed. Findings of the project will inform health management policies concerning the role pediatric and obstetric care can play in future infectious disease outbreaks as well as how UPA can provide additional hospital care.",609207,,,"Bid Awaiting Response",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",1,2024-01-01,2024-12-31,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"Funder not listed - UK Charity","Funder not listed - UK Charity Default Scheme","UK Charities (Open Competition & External Peer Review)","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"Ignacio H. de Larramendi Research Grants - Health Promotion (30k)",,https://www.fundacionmapfre.org/en/awards-aids/ignacio-larramendi-research-grants/,,"2023-10-17 09:55",,"2023-10-19 09:18",,"2024-10-18 09:18",,,"Char Leung (LTCTCL1)",,,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,"Partner not Listed,University of Cambridge",,,,"LS/HS: Population Health Sciences",,"LS/HS: Population Health Sciences","LS/HS: Population Health Sciences",,"LS/HS: Population Health Sciences",,,,,,,,"William Hudson (WOH3)",,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2023-09-20 09:06",,,,,,,22259.83,22259.83,22277.58,22277.58,22259.83,22259.83,-17.76,99.92,9607.18,43.16,4848.07,21.78,12652.64,22259.83,0.00,22259.83,0.00,22259.83,12652.64,12652.64,12652.64,22259.83,0.00,22259.83,0.00,22259.83,12652.64,0.00,3514.18,5313.16,4759.12,554.04,0.00,4311.78,0.00,22259.83,22259.83,22277.58,22277.58,22259.83,22259.83,-17.76,99.92,9607.18,43.16,4848.07,21.78,"2023-10-19 09:18:44",,Private,,"2023-09-05 09:55:12","Char Leung (LTCTCL1)","2023-10-19 09:20"

"Functional Magnetic Cloaking & Shielding Metamaterials with Non-Isotropic Media",Cloak,"Creating environments devoid of magnetic fields is a formidable challenge. This project seeks to design metamaterials capable of functional magnetic cloaking and shielding, offering applications in diverse sectors. The endeavour addresses the complexities of modelling superconductors and soft ferromagnetic materials within non-circular geometries and in non-isotropic magnetic cloaking conditions. We will establish functional relationships between cloaking/shielding effectiveness by the inverse parametrization of material properties in superconducting/ferromagnetic bilayers for a broad range of bodies within a single framework. These functional metastructures will improve magnetic sensing and reliability issues in electronics, healthcare, precision measurement, metal processing, and critical aerospace control systems.",632582,,,"Bid Approval",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",2,2024-10-01,2026-01-31,,"RF - Research Fellowship",Research,,"THE LEVERHULME TRUST The Leverhulme Trust","THE LEVERHULME TRUST Default Scheme","UK Charities (Open Competition & External Peer Review)","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"Research Fellowships",,https://www.leverhulme.ac.uk/research-fellowships,,"2023-11-09 16:00",65000.00,,,,,,"Harold Ruiz (HSRR1)",,,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,,,,"SE/EN: Engineering",,"SE/EN: Engineering","SE/EN: Engineering",,"SE/EN: Engineering",,,,,,,,,,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Funder's deadline: 9 November 4PM",,64972.43,,68172.73,,64972.43,-3200.30,95.31,-3200.30,-4.93,-3200.30,-4.93,64972.43,64972.43,0.00,64972.43,0.00,64972.43,68172.73,68172.73,64972.43,64972.43,0.00,64972.43,0.00,64972.43,5500.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,64972.43,,68172.73,,64972.43,,-3200.30,95.31,-3200.30,-4.93,-3200.30,-4.93,"2023-10-18 14:53:38",,Private,,"2023-10-16 12:29:11","Harold Ruiz (HSRR1)","2023-10-18 14:53"

"Genome control by cohesin ligands",,"The organisation of mammalian genomes in 3D nuclear space is critical for genome function. The cohesin complex is a key player in this organisation. Cohesin extrudes DNA loops, accumulates at specific genomic sites, and adopts distinct structural and functional states that link genome topology to genomic processes. These include transcription, replication, repair, recombination, sister chromatic cohesion and chromosome segregation. How cohesin controls such diverse biological processes is a major question in genome biology. Addressing this knowledge gap is important because the processes coordinated by cohesin are central to human development, homeostasis and disease. Here we address how cohesin controls genomic processes and how cohesin function is regulated by a network of interacting proteins. We propose to address these aims by a collaborative, interdisciplinary approach that combines our expertise in structural biology, biochemistry, cell biology, model organisms and integrative imaging across scales. This will link atomic structures to molecular mechanisms and organismal functions.",631941,,,"Bid Development",,Pending,"Daniel Panne (DP418),Pre-award Admin",6,2024-11-01,2030-10-31,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"ERC European Research Council (ERC)",,"EU Government Bodies (inc European Commission but not UK)","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,Synergy,,"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/erc-2024-syg;callCode=null;freeTextSearchKeyword=;matchWholeText=true;typeCodes=0,1,2,8;statusCodes=31094501,31094502,31094503;programmePeriod=null;programCcm2Id=43108390;programDivisionCode=43108406;focusAreaCode=null;destinationGroup=null;missionGroup=null;geographicalZonesCode=null;programmeDivisionProspect=null;startDateLte=null;startDateGte=null;crossCuttingPriorityCode=null;cpvCode=null;performanceOfDelivery=null;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc;onlyTenders=false;topicListKey=topicSearchTablePageState",,,,,,,,,"Daniel Panne (DP418)",,,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,"Imperial College London",,,,"LS: Molecular & Cell Biology",,"LS: Molecular & Cell Biology","LS: Molecular & Cell Biology",,"LS: Molecular & Cell Biology",,,,,,,,,,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2352016.06,,2939747.56,,2352016.06,-587731.50,80.01,1004156.38,42.69,754539.70,32.08,1344238.05,2352016.06,0.00,2352016.06,0.00,2352016.06,1347859.69,1347859.69,1344238.05,2352016.06,0.00,2352016.06,0.00,2352016.06,386616.00,310656.00,3000.00,808958.67,249616.67,241237.80,29104.20,782929.20,0.00,2352016.06,,2939747.56,,2352016.06,,-587731.50,80.01,1004156.38,42.69,754539.70,32.08,"2023-10-18 10:28:47",,Private,,"2023-10-13 15:22:17","Daniel Panne (DP418)","2023-10-18 12:18"

"Changing values, changing identities: Reassessing public attitudes towards society and nation in Britain, c. 1939 to 1979",,"This project will use secondary analysis of opinion polls hosted by the UK Data Archive and the ERSC-funded UK Gallup Poll Collection to test influential models of social change and national identity in mid twentieth-century Britain. Contemporary debates over the existence or otherwise of a ‘generation gap’, a ‘permissive society’ and ‘women’s emancipation’ continue to divide historians. Equally contested are the concepts of Americanisation, popular imperialism, post-imperial nostalgia that inform work on the evolution of national identity, and of the extent to which Britain evolved into a multicultural society. The recent release of full datasets for hundreds of Gallup polls from this period, when augmented by the NOP and wartime BIPO polls hosted by the UKDA, enables public opinions on youth, morality, gender equality, America, Empire, decolonisation and migration to be assessed afresh. The representative samples and chronological span of these polls offer more reliable measures of British attitudes over time than do individual sociological studies or the widely used Mass-Observation archive. Moreover, polling organisations’ systematic recording and sampling of demographic characteristics enable greater precision in identifying how these attitudes varied along lines of class, gender, age, nation, region, religion, education, voting intention and marital and parental status. By applying quantitative techniques to cultural history, the project will simultaneously broaden the methodology of contemporary British history and supply new answers to some of its most vital and intractable questions.",633445,,,"Bid Development",,Pending,"Ben Clements (BC101),Pre-award Admin",1,2025-01-01,2025-12-31,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"ESRC ESRC (ECON & SOC RES COUNCIL)","ESRC Default Scheme","Research Councils - ESRC","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"ESRC responsive mode: secondary data analysis round two",,https://www.ukri.org/opportunity/esrc-responsive-mode-secondary-data-analysis-round-two/,,"2024-01-25 16:25",300000.00,,,,,,"Ben Clements (BC101)",,,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,"Loughborough University",,,,"SS/HP: Politics & International Relation",,"SS/HP: Politics & International Relation","SS/HP: Politics & International Relation",,"SS/HP: Politics & International Relation",,,,,,,,,,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.00,,0.00,,0.00,0.00,0,0.00,0,0.00,0,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,,0.00,,0.00,,0.00,0,0.00,0,0.00,0,"2023-10-17 16:45:50",,Private,,"2023-10-17 16:24:05","Ben Clements (BC101)","2023-10-17 16:45"

"Deviant deaths: research and methodological gaps in managing death at the border",,"The complex issue of obligations towards irregular migrants has been debated for many years with results in topics such as asylum, integration and expulsion. Little if any attention has been dedicated however to the obligations towards irregular migrants dying during border crossing, especially when they do not carry any identification or other documentation. Relevant aspects of International Humanitarian Law (IHL) do not apply in migration while International Human Rights Law sidesteps the issue of migrant deaths, allowing for a diversity of practices at state level. As a result, these practices often fall short of the established dignified funeral and commemoration practices, varying from makeshift cemeteries to unmarked graves and bodies stored in fridges. My research project will conduct a scope review of the practices in the three Southern European entry points in Spain, Italy and Greece with an aim to provide recommendations for states to establish best practices around their duties to treat individuals with respect and dignity after death.",632302,,,"Bid Development",,Pending,"Myriam Fotou (MF267),Pre-award Admin",2,2024-06-01,2025-11-30,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"BRITISH ACADEMY The British Academy","BA/Leverhulme Small Research Grants","Research Councils (BEIS) - Roy Society and Brit Academy","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,,,https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/funding/ba-leverhulme-small-research-grants/,,"2023-11-08 17:00",10000.00,,,,,,"Myriam Fotou (MF267)",,,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,,,,"SS/HP: Politics & International Relation",,"SS/HP: Politics & International Relation","SS/HP: Politics & International Relation",,"SS/HP: Politics & International Relation",,,,,,"99 - Not Applicable for Institute reporting",,"Ellen Puurman (EP258)",,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Politics & international studies",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5750.00,,5750.00,,5750.00,0.00,100,0.00,0,0.00,0,5750.00,5750.00,0.00,5750.00,0.00,5750.00,5750.00,5750.00,5750.00,5750.00,0.00,5750.00,0.00,5750.00,5750.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,5750.00,,5750.00,,5750.00,,0.00,100,0.00,0,0.00,0,"2023-10-17 14:04:48",,Discoverable,,"2023-10-16 09:37:47","Myriam Fotou (MF267)","2023-10-17 14:05"

"Multimode attitude and orbit control system for in-orbit servicing",,"In this collaborative project between the universities of  Leicester and Surrey, relative attitude and orbit control systems and algorithms will be developed to control a chaser cubesat towards a non cooperative target cubesat for in-orbit servicing.

Multimode relative navigation and control algorithms will be developed to manage the close formations, rendezvous and magnetic docking modes and the safety and stability of the mode transitions. They will first be validated in simulation before being tested and validated in real time using air cushioned  cubesat  simulators floating over a granite table facility from the Surrey Space Centre, University of Surrey.

Algorithms will be developed to control the linear relative orbital dynamics and nonlinear attitude dynamics using relative motion feedback and using onboard propulsion for both attitude and orbit control, assuming realistic  relative orbit scenarios, such as the 2:1 ellipse, teardrop and drifting orbits.

Control algorithms will allow for the estimation and compensation of   disturbances on the attitude, including aerodynamic and magnetic torques due to magnetic docking equipment. Relative attitude and orbit estimation will be obtained by combining the fusion of relative position sensors and computer vision techniques.

At the requirements definition stage, low cost but sufficiently reliable technologies and software platforms that originated from the drones, robotics and nanosatellite system and technologies will be evaluated for the viability as cubesat systems. During the first 12 months, numerical simulations of the relative attitude control systems will be developed for realistic servicing missions scenarios and orbits, and the ability to run algorithms in real time will be tested on onboard computers with realistic capabilities. At the final experimental validation stage, algorithms will be implemented on the cubesat demonstrators, which will closely replicate systems used in cubesats.",632317,,,"Bid Development",,Pending,"Nadjim Horri (NMH22),Pre-award Admin",2,2024-02-01,2025-07-31,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"UKSA UK Space Agency","UK SPACE AGENCY Default Scheme","UK Central Government","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"UKSA Kickstarter 1 call",,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-space-innovation-programme-kick-starter-open-call-call-1/announcement-of-opportunity-nsip-kickstarter-call-1#organisation-eligibility,,"2023-11-17 12:00",,,,,,,"Nadjim Horri (NMH22)",,,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,"University of Surrey",,,,"SE/EN: Engineering",,"SE/EN: Engineering","SE/EN: Engineering",,"SE/EN: Engineering",,,,,,,,,,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Collaboration with Surrey Space Centre, University of Surrey.

I'm reaching out to you following the suggestion of Christophe Fongarland because your team were recently awarded by ESA to investigate the power management conditioning for the hybrid RTG-solar power system.
 
Although our contract on the dynamic conversion system is still ongoing, it became clear already that heat and power should be extensively managed in such the system - there are various power conversion scenarios that should be mitigated by the heat/power management system.

"Contested Desires: Constructive Dialogues",CDCD,"This is a European Commission funded project (1m euros)  – under the Creative Europe Programme (CREA) that explores contested colonial legacies and considers decolonisation, activism and resistance within the frame of imperialist European power structures and narratives. The multi-partner project explores the role that arts organisations, artist collectives, organised, community- and arts-based action and artistic outputs can play in addressing problematic retellings or erasure of our colonial past. In full recognition of the complex and contested nature of heritage and of the ways in which heritage can provide stability and rootedness for some, whilst generating alienation and trauma for others, Contested Desires will co-create spaces for difficult conversations using a bottom-up and collaborative approach. The project begins with heritage institutions and museums working in equal partnership with organisations working with artists, communities and partners. The research partners aim to develop an equitable methodology and create meaningful dialogue to extend the depth, shared understanding and approaches of cultural organisations who are thinking deeply about cultural heritage and how it is understood locally. They will compare how heritage institutions, artists and producers speak to this complex subject, and explore the role of contemporary art in questioning and opening up narratives of history and identity to scrutiny.",619817,,,"Bid Development",,Pending,"Pre-award Admin,Richard Sandell (RPS6),Suzanne MacLeod (SM100)",2,2024-01-01,2025-12-31,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"Funder not listed - Commercial","Funder not listed - Commercial Default Scheme","EU Industry, Commerce & Public Corporations","Y5 Income - Services to EU - Zero Rate",,,"Creative Europe Programme European Commission",,https://culture.ec.europa.eu/creative-europe,,"2023-09-01 07:40",,,,,,,"Suzanne MacLeod (SM100)","Richard Sandell (RPS6)",,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,,,,"SS/MS: Museum Studies",,"SS/MS: Museum Studies","SS/MS: Museum Studies",,"SS/MS: Museum Studies",,,,,,"99 - Not Applicable for Institute reporting",,"Sara Mounteney (SLM81)",,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Research Centre for Museums and Galleries.

The Orbyts programme partners passionate science researchers with groups of school students to work on original science research projects. The researchers mentor school students on a research project in 10 weekly after school sessions throughout the academic year, empowering the students to have ownership of the research. 
During these sessions, the students explore complex science topics within STFC science areas in a supportive environment which challenges their knowledge far-beyond school level physics. The researchers provide relatable role models and humanise science research on an individual level.

"Copyright law and the mental health of creators: a case study of the music industry",,"Music has important economic, cultural, and therapeutic benefits for society. However, recent research has found high levels of self-reported anxiety, depression, and eating disorders in musicians, at greater prevalence than the general population. This highlights a conflict between the value of music and the demands placed on
creators. This project addresses this from an interdisciplinary legal perspective, particularly how it relates to copyright law’s goal of ensuring that creators are motivated to continue producing creative and innovative works. Going beyond self-reported findings, this project will carry out in-depth interviews with mental health professionals to test not only if but also why musicians may be at risk of mental health issues.

"Early Prevention: Acid Violence and Changing attitudes Project",,"Acid Survivors Trust International (ASTI) are seeking an academic partner to evaluate a pilot intervention project. ASTI are proposing to develop a 'graphic novel', which will be rolled out to schools and YOTs in East London. The aim is to reduce acid violence and change attitudes towards survivors. The role of the UoL will be to develop the evaluation methodology for any future wider roll out.  With their experience of conducting research in relation to acid attacks and of evaluation methodology, academics from the School of Criminology, University of Leicester would be well suited to do this.  We would propose to frame the pilot study evaluation work around two key questions focusing on process and outcomes: 
1.	How has the pilot intervention been implemented and does this require any future refinement?  
2.	How might effectiveness be measured?  
With these questions in mind, the pilot evaluation work would comprise four strands: 
1.	Process interviews:  up to ten interviews would be conducted with delivery partners and trainers. The purpose of those interviews would be to understand how the pilot intervention is being implemented in their area and what challenges are being encountered. Specific themes for the interviews would include: 

•	Target recruitment –how participants are recruited;
•	How the intervention is being implemented - including where and when;
•	Collection of monitoring data – what data is being collected on number of and the characteristics of participants. 

 It would be intended to conduct these interviews online via Teams or Skype.  
2.  Target group views of intervention: a further set of interviews would be conducted with recipients of the intervention. The purpose of these interviews would be to obtain some qualitative insight relating to perpetrator views about the intervention. In particular: 
•	Their views about how the intervention is being implemented by partners;
•	Views about the content of the digital comic book;
•	How the intervention increased their knowledge and awareness about the long-term psychological/ physical and negative social impact of acid violence; 
•	How the digital comic book changed their attitudes to the dangers and risks of acid violence. 
We would aim to conduct up to twenty qualitative interviews. These interviews would be conducted online via Teams or Skype and would require the assistance of the delivery partners to arrange. 
3. Development and testing of an evaluation questionnaire: A project evaluation questionnaire would be developed that would aim to capture quantitative measures of (a) knowledge and awareness of acid violence and (b) attitude change about acid violence. A questionnaire would be developed from existing survey tools that have carefully constructed measures of beliefs about aggression, attitudes towards violence, beliefs about weapons carrying and use; and attitudes to weapons carrying and use (see Dahlberg et al, 2005).  Prior to the use of the questionnaire in the field we would complete some cognitive testing with young people in Leicester (this would aim to establish that young people could read/ understand the questions).  The fully tested questionnaire would then be used in the pilot evaluation. In order to establish impact; all recipients of the intervention would need to complete the questionnaire twice. First, before the intervention in order to establish a baseline measure. Second, after intervention in order to measure impact. There would need to be some discussion about how the questionnaire would be administrated in the field and the time frames between the pre and post-tests.  It is hoped that the questionnaires could be administrated by delivery partners. These could be made available in online formats if necessary.    
4. Development of longer term outcome measures: during the pilot evaluation consideration would also be given to the development of any future evaluation methodology if the project were to be rolled out. We would make recommendations as to whether the evaluation instruments tested in the pilot phase would require refinement and also whether it would be feasible to develop further indictors of impact – such as changes in numbers of corrosive subsistence crimes across impact areas (as measured against comparison group areas). 
The findings and recommendations would be presented in a succinct twenty page report. The pilot evaluation would also be subject to University of Leicester ethical clearance.",584356,,,"Bid Approval",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",1,2023-11-01,2024-10-31,,"OH - Consultancy (OSR)",Research,,"Funder not listed - Commercial","Funder not listed - Commercial Default Scheme","EU Industry, Commerce & Public Corporations","Y5 Income - Services to EU - Zero Rate",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Matt Hopkins (MH330)",,,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,,,,"SS/CR: Criminology",,"SS/CR: Criminology","SS/CR: Criminology","SS/CR: Criminology","SS/CR: Criminology",,,,,,,,,,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin","Manish Asiani (MA689)",,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,837.65,,699.55,,698.04,138.09,119.74,429.11,51.23,429.11,51.23,407.02,698.04,0.00,698.04,0.00,698.04,408.53,408.53,407.02,698.04,0.00,698.04,0.00,698.04,0.00,0.00,0.00,33.14,0.00,33.14,0.00,257.88,0.00,837.65,,699.55,,698.04,,138.09,119.74,429.11,51.23,429.11,51.23,"2023-10-13 12:49:32",,Private,,"2023-07-14 11:06:27","Matt Hopkins (MH330)","2023-10-13 12:49"
"Climate Adaptation In Superdiverse Cities: How Do Communication Ecologies Shape Knowledge Production In The 'Leicester Lab'?",,"Scientists and policymakers emphasise the need for local community engagement with the increasingly urgent global problem of climate change. However, efforts to mitigate and adapt to a warming world most often either ""preach to the choir"" of community members already engaged with the problem or generate top-down communication strategies. The proposed project reaches out to a broad range of people living in superdiverse Leicester, a particularly instructful city -- the ""Leicester Lab"" -- for learning how diverse socio-cultural contexts shape ""environmental citizenship."" Applying the communication ecology framework to a focus group design, the project examines the communication spaces and resources -- interpersonal, cross-cultural, and institutional, including professional media and government communications channels -- that shape how people from different social and cultural groups engage with climate adaptation efforts.

To reach this aim we will first bring together key stakeholders including, but not limited to, people with lived experience, academics, clinicians, commercial research organisations and funders of research (e.g., NIHR). 
Through this effective meeting of stakeholders, we will be able to understand and build a body of knowledge around what is currently happening in research organisations and what would support them to include people with intellectual disabilities. This will enable us to develop a resource to be used by commercial companies and research funders that will support and encourage inclusion.

"Professionalising ‘Museums in Health’ practice: care, emotion, and boundary work in the museum",,"Museums in health’ (Chatterjee and Noble, 2015) describes a rapidly growing area of museum and art gallery work in the UK and internationally, whereby the cultural heritage sector is repositioned as a key partner in helping deliver health and wellbeing outcomes for individuals and communities. Museum engagement (including art galleries and heritage sites) is increasingly moving into formal healthcare, mental health and social care environments, and into ‘therapeutic relationships’ with patients and vulnerable individuals, but the sector has yet to fully understand the wide-ranging implications for the definition, organisation and development of this work. The project responds by exploring the processes of professional identity construction within ‘museums in health’ to gain insights into the responsibilities and demands of the work and its current professionalisation needs. The project aims to more fully conceptualise the nature of ‘museums in health’ practice as a distinct subfield of museum work to inform the development of sector support, training, guidance and frameworks for ‘museums in health’ careers.",631397,,,"Bid Development",,Pending,"Jennifer Creese (JLC60),Nuala Morse (NMM15),Pre-award Admin",3,2024-09-01,2027-08-31,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"ESRC ESRC (ECON & SOC RES COUNCIL)","ESRC Default Scheme","Research Councils - ESRC","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,,,,,,300000.00,,,,,,"Nuala Morse (NMM15)","Jennifer Creese (JLC60)",,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,,,,"SS/MS: Museum Studies","LS/HS: Population Health Sciences","LS/HS: Population Health Sciences,SS/MS: Museum Studies","SS/MS: Museum Studies","LS/HS: Population Health Sciences","LS/HS: Population Health Sciences,SS/MS: Museum Studies",,,,,,,,,,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,188188.22,,245827.51,,235235.27,-57639.29,76.55,167468.94,88.99,38396.71,20.4,19341.67,235235.27,0.00,235235.27,0.00,235235.27,20719.28,20719.28,19341.67,235235.27,0.00,235235.27,0.00,235235.27,0.00,0.00,0.00,140007.23,129072.23,10935.00,0.00,85101.00,0.00,188188.22,,245827.51,,235235.27,,-57639.29,76.55,167468.94,88.99,38396.71,20.4,"2023-10-12 15:33:43",,Private,,"2023-10-12 15:24:46","Nuala Morse (NMM15)","2023-10-19 11:06"

"Tracking the coral Giants to predict coral reef health under anthropogenically warming oceans",TrackGiants,"=""-multi-century old, often massive corals are true survivors of climate change due to their stress tolerant life history traits
-Species include Porites sp., Diploastrea sp. in the Indo-Pacific and Orbicella sp. in the Caribbean, with maximum ages in the range of 400-600 years of continuous upwards growth
-these massive and long-lived corals harbor unique genetically encoded strategies which allow them to withstand acute and chronic environmental stressors including those from variations in temperature, nutrient levels, suspended sediment concentrations…
-giant corals are supported by a strong scaffolding, their calcium carbonate skeleton, given them unique abilities to withstand high energy events like cyclones and storm waves
-the old giants are the elders of the global coral reefs and provide a structure for colonization by a variety of reef building organisms like anemones, sea fans (Alcyonacea), Christmas worms, sea urchins, bryozoans, soft corals, gorgonians and provide unique cryptic habitat underneath and in between their massive skeletal structures for sponges and a multitude of reef fish - all together they form super-biodiversity hotspots within a reefal network carefully spaced in particular habitats - (they may serve as geographical position markers for larger predators and turtles?)
-their massive size makes them easily extremely vulnerable to human fishing gear (nets and lines)  and boat engine and anker damage
-many fishing communities know about  the existence of some of the giants from their daily fishing excursions, yet often lack the knowledge of their immense age and value to the local biodiversity
-once fishing communities are made aware of their old age they suddenly achieve significance as natural and cultural heritage structures under the sea that are extremely worth protecting from anthropogenic stressors
-the giants can tell stories locked in their chemical, micro- and macro morphological and genetic makeup about the long-term climatic and environmental changes that have shaped the reef and the giants themselves over many centuries, often providing a direct link to human storylines of past experiences of climate variations by village elders passed down from generation to generation, making them extremely powerful adaptation tools in response to challenging environmental events and periods
-we aim to tap into this tight connection of fishing communities with their reef environment and their cultural heritage to map out the distribution of the true giants geographically to develop mapped out zones of protecting the giants from anthropogenic impacts, use photogrammetry to accurately measure their size and circumference and help species identification aided by micro- and macro morphological taxonomy, 
-furthermore we will characterize their genetic makeup incl. whole genome sequencing to specify regional genetic adaptations to environmental conditions to identify genetic traits that underpin their ability to have exceptional long life spans and sustaining stressful acute and chronic events - we aim to identify why certain regions harbor those giants
-we will develop long histories of skeletal growth and the geochemical composition of the corals at annual resolution for various proxies reflecting physical ocean properties incl. temperature, nutrient cycles (d15N), salinity, pH and sediment input (where appropriate) to develop environmental storylines that will resonate with fishing communities in providing solid knowledge for education and conservation measures 

-the project is urgent because current ocean warming and long-lasting marine heatwaves have started to affect some of those giants through coral bleaching potentially losing them before we understand the genetic adaptations that helped them survive up to now - those specific genetic adaptations may harbor untapped scientific information that would help to ensuring the survival of the giants and the species that surround and depend on them, including humans""",631207,,,"Bid Development",,Pending,"Jens Zinke (JZ262),Pre-award Admin",3,2024-10-01,2027-09-30,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"Funder not listed - Commercial","Funder not listed - Commercial Default Scheme","EU Industry, Commerce & Public Corporations","Y5 Income - Services to EU - Zero Rate",,,"CORDAP Coral Accelerator Program (CAP) 2023",,https://cordap.org/awards2023/,,"2023-11-11 12:05",,,,,,,"Jens Zinke (JZ262)",,,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,,,,"SE/GE: Geology","SE/PA: National Centre for Earth Obs'","SE/GE: Geology,SE/PA: National Centre for Earth Obs'","SE/GE: Geology","SE/PA: National Centre for Earth Obs'","SE/GE: Geology,SE/PA: National Centre for Earth Obs'",,,,,,,,,,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Pre-proposal due November 11th 2023",,0.00,,0.00,,0.00,0.00,0,0.00,0,0.00,0,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,,0.00,,0.00,,0.00,0,0.00,0,0.00,0,"2023-10-12 12:13:30",,Private,,"2023-10-12 12:03:05","Jens Zinke (JZ262)","2023-10-12 12:14"

"Reactive Sulfur Species mediate oxidative stress in ageing and disease",,"While cellular oxidative stress is a fundamental driver of disease and ageing, reactive oxygen species (ROS) inhibition fails to alter ageing, disease initiation or outcomes. This suggests that other cellular oxidants may significantly contribute to oxidative stress. 

I recently discovered that reactive sulfur species (RSS), such as persulfides and polysulfides, are limited by superoxide dismutase (SOD1). This indicates that endogenous RSS, whose concentrations far exceed ROS, may contribute to cellular oxidative stress. I have also published that RSS are potent cellular oxidants that induce stress signalling. Therefore, RSS, which are not affected by ROS-targeting antioxidants, may be significant contributors to cellular oxidative stress. 

Our key goal is to determine if reactive sulfur species (RSS) drive the cellular effects of oxidative stress. Using in vivo and ex vivo models of ageing, cancer, and diabetes, the role of RSS in oxidative stress will be delineated. Specifically, protein oxidation and aggregation, genomic instability, and inflammation will be investigated. Collectively, these studies will determine if endogenous RSS contribute to cellular oxidative stress in ageing and disease. This bold programme will be paradigm shifting, as it will provide deeper understanding of, and potentially strategies to limit, disease and ageing.",630940,,,"Bid Development",,Pending,"Christopher Switzer (CS876),Pre-award Admin",8,2024-07-01,2032-06-30,,"RF - Research Fellowship",Research,,"WELLCOME TRUST Wellcome Trust","WELLCOME TRUST Default Scheme","UK Charities (Open Competition & External Peer Review)","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"Career Development Award",,https://wellcome.org/grant-funding/schemes/career-development-awards,,"2023-11-16 17:00",,,,,,,"Christopher Switzer (CS876)",,,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,,,,"LS: Molecular & Cell Biology",,"LS: Molecular & Cell Biology","LS: Molecular & Cell Biology",,"LS: Molecular & Cell Biology",,,,,,,,,,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,997323.04,,2385639.45,,997323.04,-1388316.41,41.81,-137854.39,-13.82,-357942.41,-35.89,997323.04,997323.04,0.00,997323.04,0.00,997323.04,1135177.43,1135177.43,997323.04,997323.04,0.00,997323.04,0.00,997323.04,0.00,0.00,0.00,484553.03,220088.03,235993.50,28471.50,765909.00,0.00,997323.04,,2385639.45,,997323.04,,-1388316.41,41.81,-137854.39,-13.82,-357942.41,-35.89,"2023-10-12 09:31:04",,Private,,"2023-10-12 08:50:40","Christopher Switzer (CS876)","2023-10-14 11:51"

The DAC have an inhouse team of two senior researchers but want an academic team to lead on a two part evaluation comprising, firstly, a scoping of existing data sets, and secondly, an in depth analysis at selected courts of a sample of cases, including focus groups/interviews with interested parties. The aim is to pilot the mechanism for roll out on a periodic review basis.

This project runs on from a previous design project undertaken by Mandy Burton and Rosemary Hunter (Kent University). It is intended that Mandy will lead on this project and Rosemary Hunter be included as a direct cost co I / consultant for the scoping element of the study. This collaboration began as part of their co-authorship of the Harm Panel report into family cases (MoJ, 2020).

This project builds on the Harm Panel report recommendations, part of a REF case study for REF 2021.

"Development and evaluation of an online FeNO-guided primary care asthma management intervention",DEFINE,"Background: asthma remains a big problem 5.4 million people in the UK have asthma, which costs the NHS £1.1 billion/year. 300 people/day are admitted to hospital and 3 people die daily. Most deaths and attacks could be prevented by better treatment. People can mostly control asthma by taking preventer inhalers every day to reduce inflammation and reliever inhalers as needed but for flare-ups (exacerbations), people may need steroid tablets, or even admission to hospital. Monitoring inflammation in asthma: using FeNO in general practice Asthma is caused by inflammation but how people feel does not always match how much inflammation is in their airways. Hospital clinics sometimes use a simple breath test called fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) to measure inflammation. This helps them ensure that patients are taking their inhalers properly and are on the right dose to prevent exacerbations. Measuring FeNO can also help show who can reduce treatment safely, potentially lessening side-effects, improving quality of life, and saving costs. 75% of asthma patients have an annual GP check-up. However, it is not clear yet whether FeNO measurement helps at these check-ups. At the moment, it's only done in people with severe asthma who attend a hospital clinic. It may be that using these tests more widely would cut asthma attacks and help decide when the inhaler doses need increasing or can be cut. NICE has asked for further research. Research plan: Our research will: -Produce an online training package for doctors and nurses in GP surgeries to help them use FeNO effectively -See if this package reduces exacerbations and improves quality of life. -Help policymakers make asthma services more efficient. We will work with asthma experts, GPs, nurses and patients. Professionals and patients at GP surgeries will try out our package and suggest improvements. We will do a research study involving over 2500 asthma patients from around 130 GP surgeries. Patient representatives will be involved at all stages, including helping to design study materials and information leaflets and making sure that the study is acceptable to patients. Working with the public and patients We have expertise in involving asthma patients and developing training packages for professionals. We are working with Asthma UK, who have helped us to plan the study and will raise awareness about our research. One of the members of our team is a patient with asthma who has contributed the patient perspective. We have also received valuable advice and support from our NIHR PPI advisor. We will go on to form a core group of 6 patient advisors who will be offered appropriate training and who will meet 3 times a year. We will invite 2 people with asthma to join the Trial Steering Committee. Research question Does implementation of an optimised FeNO-guided management intervention during routine primary care asthma reviews reduce acute exacerbations of asthma? Background Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the cornerstone of treatment to reduce eosinophilic airway inflammation and prevent acute exacerbations. However, despite a 30% increase in spending on ICS treatment in England since 2007, annual asthma-related mortality, hospitalisation and exacerbation rates have not improved since 2000. Most monitoring of asthma occurs in primary care, where treatment decisions are based on symptoms and lung function. However, these measures do not reliably indicate eosinophilic airway inflammation or future exacerbation risk. Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) is a simple, non-invasive breath test which is already extensively used to assess eosinophilic airway inflammation in UK hospital settings, but rarely in primary care. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recognises the value of FeNO in diagnosis of asthma, but has highlighted the need for more robust evidence to guide its use in monitoring asthma treatment. Aims and objectives To iteratively develop and refine a complex online FeNO-guided asthma management intervention for use in primary care. To determine whether our intervention is more effective than usual care in reducing acute exacerbations of asthma. To assess the cost-effectiveness of our intervention. To investigate potential influences on implementation and outcomes of our intervention in primary care. Methods To develop and refine our intervention, we will conduct systematic theory, evidence and person-based intervention planning informed by consultation with stakeholders, qualitative interviews with health care professionals and patients, and small-scale implementation in general practices. We will then evaluate the effectiveness of our intervention by conducting a pragmatic parallel randomised controlled trial (RCT) in UK general practices. To optimise our recruitment strategy and procedures, we will perform a three-month internal pilot phase, proceeding to the main phase if pre-specified progression criteria are met. We will conduct an economic evaluation based on trial findings to determine whether our intervention is cost-effective and a mixed methods process evaluation of our intervention involving quantitative process outcomes and qualitative interviews with health care professionals and patients. Timelines for delivery We will produce our optimised intervention during the first 18 months of our programme and complete the internal pilot phase of our RCT by the end of year 2, progressing to the main phase in year 3. We will aim to complete recruitment by the end of year 3 and collection of follow-up data by the end of year 4. We will complete our analysis of RCT data, economic evaluation, and process evaluation by the end of year 5. Anticipated impact and dissemination Our findings will have strong potential to influence national guidelines and clinical practice within five years of this programme being completed. We will work with policymakers and guideline developers to incorporate our findings into BTS/SIGN and NICE guidance. We will also make our online intervention freely available to health care professionals and raise awareness of our intervention through scientific publications, conference presentations, educational workshops, and patient organisations including Asthma UK.",630702,,,"Bid Development",,Pending,"Janet Harris (JH68),Pre-award Admin",3,2023-11-01,2025-11-30,,"RC - Research Clinical Trial",Research,,"NIHR National Institute of Health Research","Programme Grants for Applied Research (PGfAR)","UK Central Government","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Janet Harris (JH68)",,,"Only people involved in this project",,"University of Oxford",Yes,"University of Nottingham,University of Southampton",,,,"LS: Respiratory Sciences",,"LS: Respiratory Sciences","LS: Respiratory Sciences",,"LS: Respiratory Sciences",,Yes,,,,,,,,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Dominick Shaw joining UoL from 01.11.2023",,3453.85,,5061.21,,3453.85,-1607.35,68.24,3453.85,100,-17.27,-0.5,0.00,3453.85,0.00,3453.85,0.00,3453.85,0.00,0.00,0.00,3453.85,0.00,3453.85,0.00,3453.85,0.00,0.00,0.00,3879.25,3471.12,364.19,43.94,1181.96,0.00,3453.85,,5061.21,,3453.85,,-1607.35,68.24,3453.85,100,-17.27,-0.5,"2023-10-11 14:39:52",,Discoverable,,"2023-10-11 13:50:32","Janet Harris (JH68)","2023-10-11 14:39"

"Round Mounds of the Isle of Man Post-Excavation","RMIOM Post-Ex","Since 2016 Dr Rachel Crellin (University of Leicester) and Prof Chris Fowler (Newcastle University) have co-directed the 'Round Mounds of the Isle of Man' project, investigating Neolithic and Early Bronze Age burials and mortuary monuments on the Isle of Man (c. 4000-1500 BC). The work has included analysis of historic records and LiDAR imagery, geophysical surveys, osteological analysis of prehistoric human remains in the Manx Museum collection, radiocarbon dating, ancient DNA analysis, and stable isotope analysis of human remains. A brief summary of these results is presented below, but collectively they significantly enhance our ability to understand life and death in these periods of the distant past. The project also involved excavation of Neolithic occupation activity and an Early Bronze Age burial mound at Cronk Guckley, Berk Farm, Kirk Michael, the first such site to be excavated on the Isle of Man using twenty-first century archaeological methods, and the first on the island to yield an iconic jet spacer-plate necklace.

The current funding application is for a final phase of work which includes post-excavation analysis of the environmental evidence, artefacts and human remains found during the excavation and production of a monograph to complete the entire project. The funding is necessary to finish the archaeological research and present it for both a broad and specialist readership, and to archive all of the project data and the archaeological remains recovered from the excavation with Manx National Heritage. The monograph will tell the story of 2500 years of life and death on the Isle of Man long before recorded history, explore the identities, lives and deaths of those whose remains were buried at Berk Farm, and set the course of prehistory on the Isle of Man in its wider regional context.

"Either here or there: A mixed method analysis of consultation modalities for epilepsy reviews with people with Intellectual disabilities",N/A,"Around 400,000 people with intellectual disabilities (PwID) in the UK have epilepsy. PwID and epilepsy have worse health
outcomes than those without epilepsy or Intellectual Disabilities. There are also differences in health outcomes within the PwID
and epilepsy population. Older PwID and epilepsy (>40 years ), and those with more severe conditions are at greater risk of
preventable epilepsy related harm or increased emergency care use for conditions that could have been managed or treated in
the community.
During COVID-19 this patient population continued to receive routine care from specialist doctors, but it was often over the
phone or a video call rather than in person, face-to-face. Care continues to be provided using these various approaches, but
we do not know which ways of providing care work best for which patients, and when.
It is important to examine this for different groups of patients, particularly those who are most vulnerable and those most at risk
of reduced inclusion through hybrid approaches. Therefore, we will focus on three groups within the ID community:
1. PwID and epilepsy who are unable to engage in a consultation themselves and need their families and carers to
speak for them (usually have moderate to profound ID).
2. PwID and epilepsy who can engage in a consultation but not without the support of family or a carer(usually have mild
to moderate ID).
3. People with mild ID and epilepsy who self-manage their own health.
Aims
We want to know more about healthcare professionals, patient and carer preference for different types of appointments,
explore the benefits or disadvantages for different groups and examine views and issues about patient safety related to
consultation type (phone/video/face-to-face).
Design and methods
We will carry out surveys and interviews (co-produced with experts by experience) with the patient populations mentioned, and
their families and carers. In addition, we will conduct surveys and interviews with members of the clinical and administrative
teams involved with the delivery of care/consultations to find out about the experiences of participating in consultations inperson,
over the phone or through video-link.
PPI
Public advisor input from carers and also input from patient advisor(s) with mild ID and epilepsy have provided their views on
the importance of this topic area. They will be working with us throughout this study to provide their lived experience to our
understanding of the issues. They will co-produce study documentation, contribute to meetings throughout, and be involved
with the interpretation of the findings.
Dissemination
Workshops, peer reviewed publications, stakeholder and academic presentations and dissemination to target policy and
practitioner-based audiences via Applied Research Collaboration (ARC) newsletters, blogs and social media. We will
disseminate to lay audiences using lay summaries and our PPI and third sector collaborators.",630431,,,"Bid Approval",Locked,Pending,"HoD Approval Health Sciences",1,2024-07-01,2025-06-30,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"NIHR National Institute of Health Research","NIHR Default Scheme","UK Central Government","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"Research for Patient Benefit: Competition 52",,https://www.nihr.ac.uk/documents/research-for-patient-benefit-programme-competition-dates-2019/20625#competition-52,,"2023-11-08 10:05",500000.00,,,,,,"Sam Tromans (ST386)",,,"Only people involved in this project",,"University of Plymouth",Yes,,,,,"LS/HS: Population Health Sciences",,"LS/HS: Population Health Sciences","LS/HS: Population Health Sciences",,"LS/HS: Population Health Sciences",,,,,,"99 - Not Applicable for Institute reporting",,"Thomas Barson (TB199)",,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Please note that the lead unit at Leicester is Population Health Sciences, but the lead unit overall is University of Plymouth.

"Cardiovascular Risk Detection, Intervention, and  Outreach in Sub-Saharan Africa",CARDIOSSA,"Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are  rising in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), constituting 35% of deaths . Cardiovascular diseases (CVD), diabetes, and hypertension are the most common NCDs, with CVD leading the NCD-related death toll in SSA2. Over 75% of global CVD deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), with 3 out of every 4 adults of the world's 537 million diabetes cases are in LMICs. In SSA, approximately 4-5% of adults have type 2 diabetes, mostly undiagnosed, and 19-31% are overweight. Hypertension affects over 1.1 billion globally, with two-thirds in LMICs. SSA faces increasing average blood pressure levels and the world's lowest awareness, treatment, and control rates. These conditions  reduce life expectancy by about 6 years. Factors contributing to this surge include urbanization, changing lifestyles, healthcare system focus on communicable diseases, an aging population , low health literacy, healthcare disparities, underfunded systems, and complex socio-cultural beliefs. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) prevalence is also underestimated, with genetic factors like APOL1 playing a role. NCDs receive insufficient attention in public health programs, and prevention and detection strategies are often imported from Western models. There is a critical need to re-design CVD prevention strategies to be context-specific and co-created with local communities.

"Unveiling the complexity of breast cancer by leveraging single-cell multi-OMICS: Analysis of circulating tumour cells for improved patient management",,"Breast cancer (BC) mortality rates have decreased in recent years, but recurrence remains a significant challenge. Improved prognostic and predictive tests for treatment response are needed, as current methods relying on tissue biopsies and imaging have limitations. Liquid biopsies, such as analyzing circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and circulating tumor cells (CTCs), offer a minimally invasive and promising approach for tracking cancer progression. However, ctDNA may not be the optimal biomarker for studying disease progression, and CTCs hold potential for determining treatment resistance and guiding therapy.

CTCs carry comprehensive information about the parent tumor, including proteins, DNA, and RNA, making them valuable for analyzing tumor heterogeneity and relapse. Previous studies have shown that CTC counts alone do not predict survival outcomes in breast cancer. Therefore, understanding CTC biology at the single-cell level is crucial due to cellular heterogeneity.
New technologies have emerged to detect heterogeneous CTCs, including those undergoing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). These advancements aim to improve on existing systems like CellSearch, which only detect epithelial CTCs expressing EpCAM. However, these platforms are costly, and isolating pure single CTCs is challenging due to white blood cell contamination. Simplifying and cost-effective workflows are necessary for detecting and isolating individual CTCs while preserving their integrity for analysis.
In this research project, a collaboration with Thermofisher Scientific will be established to develop a novel workflow using the KingFisherTM Apex robotic system. This system aims to isolate CTCs with high purity, minimizing white blood cell background. The KingFisherTM Apex has shown comparable recovery rates to CellSearch and Parsortix systems but demonstrated superior background levels. The low white blood cell background allows for advanced analysis and sequencing of single cells.
The project will refine the KingFisher workflow and integrate it with the PhenoImager Fusion system for deep single-cell phenotyping and spatial analysis of CTCs. The evaluation of transmembrane glycoproteins like TROP-2 and HER2 will be conducted, exploring their potential as antibody-drug conjugate targets. The project will also investigate whether molecular profiling of CTCs enables the successful triage of patients for highly toxic antibody-drug conjugates.
The research will be embedded within the ongoing ATHENA study, enriching blood samples for CTCs using the KingFisherTM Apex. Deep-cell phenotyping and spatial analysis will be performed using the Akoya PhenoImager Fusion system. Additionally, CTCs will be isolated for transcriptomics, and single-cell gene expression analysis will be conducted using the 10X Genomics and Oxford Nanopore Technologies systems.
This ambitious fellowship aims to develop a liquid biopsy-based multi-omics workflow for identifying biomarkers in CTCs to guide treatment decisions in metastatic breast cancer (mBC). The research will contribute to expanding our understanding of CTCs and resistance mechanisms, potentially uncovering novel therapeutic targets to improve the management of mBC patients globally.",567018,,,"Bid Awaiting Response",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",3,2024-01-01,2026-12-31,,"RF - Research Fellowship",Research,,"Funder not listed - UK Charity","Funder not listed - UK Charity Default Scheme","UK Charities (Open Competition & External Peer Review)","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,," Black in Cancer Postdoctoral fellowship",,https://www.blackincancer.com/copy-of-opportunities,,,,"2023-10-10 11:52",,"2024-10-09 00:00",,,"Emmanuel Acheampong (EA335)","Jacqui Shaw (JS39)",,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,,,,"LS/GG: Cancer Research Centre",,"LS/GG: Cancer Research Centre","LS/GG: Cancer Research Centre",,"LS/GG: Cancer Research Centre",,,,,,,,,,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2023-06-22 15:00",,,,,,"No cost available at this moment",160714.29,160714.29,406179.45,406179.45,160714.29,160714.29,-245465.16,39.57,-16493.16,-10.26,-16493.16,-10.26,160714.29,160714.29,0.00,160714.29,0.00,160714.29,177207.45,177207.45,160714.29,160714.29,0.00,160714.29,0.00,160714.29,0.00,0.00,0.00,58770.00,0.00,52443.00,6327.00,170202.00,0.00,160714.29,160714.29,406179.45,406179.45,160714.29,160714.29,-245465.16,39.57,-16493.16,-10.26,-16493.16,-10.26,"2023-10-10 11:52:11",,Private,,"2023-06-13 13:27:27","Emmanuel Acheampong (EA335)","2023-10-10 11:52"

"Understanding the mechanism of IgAN progression",,"IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is a chronic kidney disease that occurs when an antibody called, immunoglobulin A (IgA) builds-up in the kidney. Normally, IgA plays a key role in the immune system in fighting against infections. However, in people with IgAN, a defective form of IgA antibody accumulates in the glomeruli (the blood filtration units of the kidney) prompting a series of adverse immune responses. This ultimately results in severe damage of the glomeruli, disruption of blood filtration processes and possible loss kidney function. 

IgAN is often diagnosed in young adults and due to its progressive nature, the life expectancy of affected persons is reduced by up to 10 years. It is a debilitating condition that not only imposes a significant burden on patients' physical and emotional well-being, but also strains healthcare systems due to the high costs associated with long-term treatment.

The severity of IgAN varies among patients. Some people have mild symptoms and may not need treatment, while others have more severe symptoms and may need medication or even a kidney transplant. About 3 out of 10 IgAN patients progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) within 10 years of being diagnosed. 

My research seeks to understand why IgAN affects people differently. I would like to find out if the severity of the disease is related to the type of IgA proteins that are produced by the patient. I would also like to investigate the contribution of two types of cells found in the glomeruli (namely, mesangial cells and endothelial cells) to IgAN development. By carrying out these investigations, I hope to better understand which factors drive the progression of IgAN.",609609,,,"Bid Development",,Pending,"Chidimma Mbadugha (CM825),Jonathan Barratt (JB81),Pre-award Admin",1,2023-10-01,2024-04-28,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"LEICESTER HOSPITALS Leicester Hospitals Charity","LEICESTER HOSPITALS Default Scheme","UK Charities (Other Process)","T3 - 20% VAT on Expenditure - not recoverable,Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"Kidney Care Appeal",,,,,,,,,,,"Chidimma Mbadugha (CM825)","Jonathan Barratt (JB81)",,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,,,,"LS: Cardiovascular Sciences",,"LS: Cardiovascular Sciences","LS: Cardiovascular Sciences",,"LS: Cardiovascular Sciences",,,,,,"99 - Not Applicable for Institute reporting","UNITED KINGDOM","Kerry Warner (KW153)",,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Clinical medicine",,,,"Not Applicable for HEBCI","Not applicable for HEBCI",,,,,,,,"Investigator applied 22.05.23 without an approved costing.

"Testing a Novel Proteomic Panel for Exclusion of Coronary Artery Disease: Internal and External Clinical Validation with a High Throughput Multiplexed Targeted Mass Spectrometry Assay.","BHF BRICCS","Coronary artery disease (CAD) poses an immense global health burden. Current risk stratification tools overestimate CAD prevalence, thus there is a need to refine risk stratification to minimise the often-inappropriate cascade of downstream imaging tests. We aim to clinically validate a novel biomarker panel of circulating proteins identified in our pilot study for exclusion of CAD in low-risk patients presenting with chest pain. Plasma samples will be processed using a high-throughput, automated proteomics protocol and the putative CAD panel measured using a targeted mass spectrometry assay. Models for predicting CAD based on the panel will be trained on an internal validation cohort and tested in external validation cohorts, prioritising high negative predictive value. Predictive gains of the panel will be compared to other CAD risk stratification techniques such as the Framingham Score, and will be assessed for sex and ethnic differences as well as discrimination of high-risk plaque features. On completion, a novel multi-marker protein biomarker panel for coronary plaque burden will be validated. Patients presenting with chest pain who are excluded from CAD using this blood test need not undergo further imaging tests, reducing costs, downstream intervention, and burden on the healthcare system.",596479,,,"Bid Development",,Pending,"Colleen Maxwell (CBM11),Pre-award Admin",3,2024-06-01,2026-11-30,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"BHF British Heart Foundation","BRITISH HEART Default Scheme","UK Charities (Open Competition & External Peer Review)","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"BHF Project Grant",,https://www.bhf.org.uk/for-professionals/information-for-researchers/what-we-fund/project-grants,,,350000.00,,,,,,"Colleen Maxwell (CBM11)",,,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,,,,"LS: Cardiovascular Sciences",,"LS: Cardiovascular Sciences","LS: Cardiovascular Sciences",,"LS: Cardiovascular Sciences",,,,,,,,,,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,213536.30,,366823.59,,213536.30,-153287.29,58.21,-427.28,-0.2,-427.28,-0.2,213536.30,213536.30,0.00,213536.30,0.00,213536.30,213963.58,213963.58,213536.30,213536.30,0.00,213536.30,0.00,213536.30,99685.99,96660.00,1025.99,39234.42,0.00,35010.56,4223.86,113625.59,0.00,213536.30,,366823.59,,213536.30,,-153287.29,58.21,-427.28,-0.2,-427.28,-0.2,"2023-10-09 13:23:33",,Private,,"2023-08-09 09:52:11","Colleen Maxwell (CBM11)","2023-10-16 09:24"

"Calorie restriction and epigenetic ageing in an insect model.",CALNAS,"An epigenetic clock measures ageing by counting chemical marks on DNA. There is evidence epigenetic age mirrors true biological age and its associated mortality better than chronological age. A large body of ageing research is based on simple model organisms. However, the current invertebrate models of ageing (fruitfly and roundworm)  lack these chemical marks, reducing their generality.

We  discovered an epigenetic clock in  a tiny wasp. We will use calorie restriction  to establish that  epigenetic ageing can be slowed. This will allow future research on  these epigenetic factors  which with known plasticity, are tempting targets for anti-ageing interventions.",490892,,,"Bid Submission",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",3,2024-09-01,2027-08-31,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"THE LEVERHULME TRUST The Leverhulme Trust","THE LEVERHULME TRUST Default Scheme","UK Charities (Open Competition & External Peer Review)","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"Research project grants",,https://www.leverhulme.ac.uk/research-project-grants,,"2023-12-01 14:30",500000.00,"2023-03-23 14:58",,"2024-03-22 00:00",,,"Eamonn Mallon (EBM3)","Ko-Fan Chen (KC280)",,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,,,,"LS: Genetics & Genome Biology",,"LS: Genetics & Genome Biology","LS: Genetics & Genome Biology",,"LS: Genetics & Genome Biology",,No,,,,"99 - Not Applicable for Institute reporting",,"Kerry Warner (KW153)",,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,"Full Application",,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2023-10-04 14:48",,,,,,,222843.21,227567.73,608839.21,610086.38,222843.21,227567.73,-382518.64,37.3,-13980.10,-6.14,-98741.09,-43.39,227567.73,227567.73,0.00,227567.73,0.00,227567.73,241547.84,241547.84,227567.73,227567.73,0.00,227567.73,0.00,227567.73,55710.28,17568.00,5149.00,157597.87,84760.98,64995.49,7841.40,210940.67,0.00,227567.73,222843.21,610086.38,608839.21,227567.73,222843.21,-382518.64,37.3,-13980.10,-6.14,-98741.09,-43.39,"2023-10-06 11:56:53",,Discoverable,,"2023-02-09 09:51:18","Eamonn Mallon (EBM3)","2023-10-06 11:56"
"AI-Thyroid-Cancer Early Detection System",,"The main goal of this proposal is to create an AI-Thyroid-Cancer Early Detection System that can analyze thyroid ultrasound images for suspicious nodules using deep learning. The proposed system is designed to be a single-backend system with multiple front ends, which features both a desktop (Web-based) and mobile interface. It will be integrated with portal ultrasound devices and software platforms to facilitate access through a user-friendly interface for ultrasound image analysis by deep learning. There will be many improvements with the proposed system over the current methods. By detecting subtle features that may be missed by human eyes, it can increase the detection rate of Thyroid cancer malignant nodules, avoid the need for biopsies and surgeries, save time and lives, and introduce new opportunities for innovation and collaboration in healthcare. We anticipate that the implementation of such a system will have far-reaching consequences for UK and Egypt's technological sector. As well as accelerating the growth of AI and the demand for AI solutions in the healthcare sector, its enormous potential may increase Egypt's international reputation and competitiveness in the AI industry.",625006,,,"Bid Development",,Pending,"Huiyu Zhou (HZ143),Pre-award Admin",1,2024-03-01,2025-02-28,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"BRITISH COUNCIL British Council","BRITISH COUNCIL Default Scheme","UK Central Government","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"Call for Applications for RESEARCH ENVIRONMENTS GRANTS 2023-24",,https://www.britishcouncil.org.eg/en/programmes/education/science/research-environment-links,,"2023-10-06 23:40",,,,,,,"Huiyu Zhou (HZ143)",,,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,,,,"SE/CM: Computing Sciences",,"SE/CM: Computing Sciences","SE/CM: Computing Sciences",,"SE/CM: Computing Sciences",,,,,,,,,,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Research partner:

Aims Among persons with prevalent or newly-diagnosed diabetes during the study period (2016-2022):
1) To (a) examine associations between lower income level and diabetes-related emergency department (ED) visits, hospitalization, and mortality during prepandemic and pandemic periods and (b) assess for an increase in the magnitude of this association during the pandemic period 
2) To (a) examine associations between lower income level and having insufficient ambulatory follow-up (< 2 diabetes-related ambulatory care visits/year; in-person or virtual) during prepandemic and pandemic periods and (b) assess for an increase in the magnitude of this association during the pandemic 
3) To evaluate for mediation of associations between material deprivation and ED visits/hospitalization/mortality by a) insufficiency of ambulatory follow-up and/or b) amenability of employment to working from home in the prepandemic and pandemic periods
Among persons with newly-diagnosed diabetes during the study period (2016-2022):
4) To (a) examine associations between lower income level and having a new diagnosis presenting as a hyperglycemic emergency (diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar state) during prepandemic and pandemic periods and (b) assess for an increase in the magnitude of this association during the pandemic period 
We will address the above aims within (a) a Canadian cohort that does not include Quebec, (b) a Quebec cohort, and (c) a cohort from England. We will compare findings between cohorts.

"Drug&tag, a method to identify the DNA signatures of clinical and environmental substances",,"Lifetime exposures that individuals can (e.g., diet, smoking, alcohol, and substance consumption) or cannot control (e.g., pollutants, therapeutics and occupational exposures) can impact the likelihood of developing disease. Besides substances directly causing alterations in the DNA sequence, the immediate effect of many exposures is altering how the information in DNA is accessed, i.e., they drive epigenetic changes. To understand the mechanisms underlying these effects it would be important to identify the exact DNA sequences a substance is likely to influence. However, this can be a long and challenging task that usually relies on first identifying the interacting proteins. Here we propose to combine in a new way currently available approaches to develop a novel method, Drug&Tag, that will identify the DNA sequences affected by clinically relevant or environmental substances without having to know which proteins they interact with. The method will use Tn5, a transposase commonly used in genomics due to its ability to cut and paste adaptor sequences in the DNA it is proximal to. Our proof of principle proposal aims to generate Tn5-compound conjugates to identify signatures for the compounds in cells, in a manner similar to the well-established Cut&Tag approach in which proteinA-Tn5 conjugate are used to tag the sequences bound by specific antibodies. Drug &Tag has two main advantages over two recently reported methods (Chem-seq and Chem-MAP) addressing the same problem: 1. the drug is directly linked to Tn5 making the method faster has it has fewer steps; 2. the compound is linked to the beads via different attachment points thus ensuring all the interactions are captured. We will first establish and validate the method using JQ1, a compound shown to work in Chem-seq/Chem-MAP; and then test the effectiveness of Drug&Tag using the dietary compound resveratrol. We predict that once establish, Drug&Tag will have a varied range of potential application and benefits. For example, it could be used to produce signatures that could help distinguish sensitivity and resistance to treatments; or to identify the targets of wide spectrum compounds (e.g., dietary, pollutants, etc); or by pharmaceutical companies to test off targets or toxicity potential of drugs. Finally, it would be generally relevant to scientists, e.g., those in the pharmaco-, neuro- and nutri-(epi)genomics fields.",624455,,,"Bid Awaiting Response",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",1,2024-01-25,2024-07-24,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"BBSRC BBSRC BIOTECH.& BIOLOG.SCIENCE","BBSRC Default Scheme","Research Councils - BBSRC","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"2023 Transformative Research Technologies (23TRT)",,https://www.ukri.org/opportunity/2023-transformative-research-technologies-23trt/,,"2023-10-05 16:00",225000.00,"2023-10-05 15:37",,"2024-10-04 00:00",,,"Cristina Tufarelli (CT296)","Robert Britton (RGB6)",,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,,,,"LS/GG: Cancer Research Centre",,"LS/GG: Cancer Research Centre","LS/GG: Cancer Research Centre",,"LS/GG: Cancer Research Centre",,No,,,,"99 - Not Applicable for Institute reporting",,"Yelena Mazulina (YM41)",,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2023-10-05 15:24",,,,,,,68235.33,68235.33,85294.17,85294.17,85294.17,85294.17,-17058.83,80,28690.45,42.05,26827.47,39.32,39544.89,85294.17,0.00,85294.17,0.00,85294.17,39544.89,39544.89,39544.89,85294.17,0.00,85294.17,0.00,85294.17,13207.10,9461.90,0.00,13127.23,1862.98,10051.58,1212.68,32622.05,0.00,68235.33,68235.33,85294.17,85294.17,85294.17,85294.17,-17058.83,80,28690.45,42.05,26827.47,39.32,"2023-10-05 15:37:25",,Discoverable,,"2023-09-29 12:11:23","Cristina Tufarelli (CT296)","2023-10-05 17:24"

"Internationalisation of Hate Crime Policies (IHaC)",IHaC,"IHaC offers a new global perspective on hate crime governance, questioning prevailing assumptions about states' adoption of hate crime policies. This ambitious project presents two bold hypotheses: that effective hate crime responses hinge on robust democratic institutions and internationally connected ""change agents""; and that state-led hate crime efforts are increasingly influenced by multilateral organisations, despite traditional state’s exclusive competence to decide in matters of crime and policing. The research highlights a rising global push for hate crime policies which prompts states to meet international standards or risk criticism. This has led to widespread policies addressing hate crimes tied to race, religion, sexual orientation, gender, and disability. However, these new frameworks can sometimes conflict with deep-seated social and legal norms, sparking debates about freedom of speech, religious rights, and concerns like neo-colonialism and gender equality. Moving beyond Western-centric studies limited to states as objects of analysis, IHaC spotlights international organisations that shape global hate crime standards. Utilising a mixed-methods approach, IHaC integrates insights from theories on criminalisation, policy diffusion, and norm transfer, significantly enriching the Hate Studies domain where this research is anchored. The project will be implemented by the Dr Piotr Godzisz as the PI and three early-career researchers based in the Centre for Hate Studies at the University of Leicester.",595505,,,"Bid Submission",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",5,2025-01-01,2029-12-31,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"ERC European Research Council (ERC)","ERC Default Scheme","EU Government Bodies (inc European Commission but not UK)","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"Starting Grant",,https://erc.europa.eu/apply-grant/starting-grant,,"2023-10-24 12:00",,,,,,,"Piotr Godzisz (PG227)",,,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,"Université libre de Bruxelles",,,"SS/CR: Hate Studies",,"SS/CR: Hate Studies","SS/CR: Hate Studies",,"SS/CR: Hate Studies",,,,,,"99 - Not Applicable for Institute reporting","BELGIUM,BRAZIL,CHILE,INDIA,MOLDOVA, REPUBLIC OF,SEYCHELLES,UNITED KINGDOM","Laura Flavell (LF211)",,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2023-10-05 14:02",,,,,,,,1151028.48,,1394324.16,,1151028.48,-243295.69,82.55,548309.91,47.64,227900.30,19.8,601599.85,1151028.48,0.00,1151028.48,0.00,1151028.48,602718.56,602718.56,601599.85,1151028.48,0.00,1151028.48,0.00,1151028.48,207889.74,0.00,0.00,374061.66,320409.61,53652.05,0.00,417543.94,0.00,1151028.48,,1394324.16,,1151028.48,,-243295.69,82.55,548309.91,47.64,227900.30,19.8,"2023-10-05 14:02:41",,Private,,"2023-08-07 14:03:07","Laura Flavell (LF211)","2023-10-16 14:01"

"The impacts and implications of de-sexing language in reproductive health communications in the UK.",,"Research question
What are the impacts and implications of de-sexed language in relation to reproductive health communications for service users in the UK?

Background
Desexing language, or new linguistic formulations that alter meaning from a biological to an identity referent, has been introduced across organisations concerned with reproductive healthcare. The use of de-sexing language is an untested intervention and has been inconsistently deployed by charities, professional colleges, and the NHS. 


Objectives
1. Conduct a scoping review about the extent and impact of de-sexed language in reproductive health communications, including innovative communication approaches.
2. Determine how the change to de-sexed language in public health information impacts service user comprehension and effects assessment of personal health risk.
3. Describe the views and attitudes of service users to de-sexed language in reproductive health, including trust and engagement with health workers and organisations.
4. Describe the views, attitudes, and self-reported practices of health workers about the use and drivers of sexed/ desexed language. 
5. Use qualitative and review data to develop, implement and evaluate an UK online survey for service users and health workers about the impact of de-sexed language.

I hope that you are well. Following on from the work I did for ESRC they asked me to do a little bit more and to write an options analysis to help implement the findings of the previous work. I’m sorry this has taken a while to get round to sorting but I now have the particulars filled in in the UKRI quotation request that details the work. I wish to pursue this in the same way as before where the monies are paid via the University into my Senate Development Fund. The rate should be as quoted before which was £780 per day and I estimate 6-7 days work which includes the work I’ve done on it to date
 
There are details in the documentation that you need to correspond with Jo Lake at ESRC and I’m also aware that this will need retrospective sign off from Head of School and Head of College etc. However, given the work I’ve done before, this is more straightforward and really does just build on the previous report so there’s no reason why any of the substantive details regarding rates etc need to change
 
Hope this make sense.

"Gypsy, Roma, Traveller Youth: Mitigating Exclusion(s) Through the Digital",,"Digital developments and participation are increasingly
important to youth in UK society, and this includes Gypsy
Roma and Traveller (GRT) young people (YP). There is scant
research evidence examining how GRT YP are using digital
technologies, but GRT voluntary sector organisations state
that use of smart phones and social media are popular daily
activities. The digital world offers connection to public and
other services, and a place for meeting, sharing knowledge,
opportunities, friendships, and networks, but there can be
risks and obstacles too. This 30-month study examines the
experiences of GRT YP (aged 15-24) and digital participation,
focusing on how online connections and networks work for YP
and how this might help counter, or cope with, socioeconomic

"The Digital Footprint Data of CryptoFinance",CRYPTOFOOTPRINTS,"1 page Outline 

This project will establish an interoperable data framework, capable of capturing, analysing and extrapolating social media, demographic, and digital asset finance data, on investor motivations in trading cryptocurrencies and other digital assets. It is imperative that we have clear foundations and knowledge on how social media, and other economic, financial, behavioural, and demographic factors affect financial decision making processes in relation to digital assets, in order to safeguard individuals, build a more resilient economic system, encourage innovation, and inform regulators. This project will thus answer the research question as to whether public and private datasets related to new forms of decentralised finance and evolving social media influences can be amalgamated in an open format database to foster rigorous and timely multidimensional and multi-focused understanding of these interactions. 

In the last few years, cryptocurrencies and other allied digital assets like NFTs, stablecoins, etc. have become mainstream; this is mainly due to the lowering of the technical barriers for creation of digital assets, proliferation of a myriad of cryptocurrencies, a social media fuelled echo-chamber, and the rise of several unregulated digital exchanges. As per the recent estimates by a digital exchange (Crypto.com) around 425 million people worldwide are investing in digital assets, mostly in a variety of cryptocurrencies and stablecoins, which the UK government estimates to be worth a combined value of USD 929.51 billion. Although there is a huge data ecosystem around digital assets comprising of blockchain data (aggregated by private companies, although most of it is technically publicly accessible), centralised exchanges data (fragmented proprietary data on investors and extrapolated market data), and social media data (what users post, comment and do on platforms as Twitter, YouTube, Reddit, Discord, Telegram etc. in relation to digital assets), there has never been any meaningful attempt to collate and study this valuable digital footprint data (DFD). 

Furthermore, given the recent scandals like the spectacular implosion of FTX resulting in estimated customer losses at more than USD 8 billion, increasing regulatory attention has attempted to capture the social dimensions and digital footprints of these phenomena. There have been some attempts in conducting surveys (FCA ran 2 surveys in 2020 and 2021) to collect demographic and financial data, as well as to evaluate the risks in the sector and the level of investor knowledge. However, to date no common database harmonising these disparate datasets produced by different regulators, mapping onto the digital footprint data of the users, has been created.
We are an experienced team of sociologists, data scientists, behavioural finance analysts and lawyers, who aim to create an accessible and interoperable data framework, in partnership with the main industry data keepers, social media platforms, and the regulators, to capture the social dimensions of decision making process in relation to digital assets, to understand the investor motivations, prevent fraud, and influence relevant regulators on their future digital asset policies and strategies.

We will first consult with digital exchanges, regulators, trade bodies, investor forums, and other stakeholders to create a DFD framework capable of capturing multidimensional data points on digital social interactions, demography, and multi-level financial data.  We will then liaise with digital exchanges and data aggregators (like CoinMarketCap,  who have already pledged to grant access to their API for free for research purposes), social media platforms (like Twitter and Facebook, to extract relevant data), and regulators (FCA, SEBI etc.) to access and create an anonymized, open source, findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable DFD as per our developed framework. The database created in this project will allow social science researchers to study how varied social, economic, financial, demographic and behavioural factors effects may have contributed to the explosive growth and continued mutual faith in digital assets. It will also provide digital exchanges, third-sector organisations, policy makers and regulators with actionable insights to create adequate mechanisms, policies and strategies to combat fraud, by providing an assessment of the transparency in the crypto sector, training dataset for autonomous decision models, and providing reliable and granular data about the social engagements in digital asset trade.

 
Summary: 
The advent of cryptocurrencies and digital assets has substantially altered the way that many think about money and investing. However, despite their growing popularity, there is still a significant knowledge gap in this area, especially around the investor motivation in converting ‘real’ money into ‘virtual’ asset. Enormous data is being generated in this digital first arena of cryptocurrency and decentralised finance, however, little is being done to systematically catalogue and study this digital footprint. This project will create a comprehensive database that captures, analyses, and extrapolates social media, demographic data on investor motivations along with the price movements and trading volumes in cryptocurrencies and other digital assets. This will develop the knowledge base and enable further research in this important area.

Cryptocurrencies and other digital assets have become mainstream in recent years, thanks in part to the lowering of technical barriers and the proliferation of a variety of cryptocurrencies. As per recent estimates by a digital exchange, Crypto.com, around 425 million people worldwide are investing in digital assets, which the UK government estimates to be worth a combined value of USD 929.51 billion. However, despite this growing interest, there has never been any meaningful attempt to collate and study this valuable digital footprint data.
Our aim is to create an accessible and interoperable data standard, in partnership with the main industry data keepers, social media platforms, and regulators, to capture the social dimensions of decision-making processes in relation to digital assets, to understand investor motivations, prevent fraud, and influence relevant regulators on their future digital asset policies and strategies.

To achieve our aim, we will first consult with digital exchanges, regulators, trade bodies, investor forums, and other stakeholders to create a digital footprint data framework capable of capturing multidimensional data points on digital social interactions, demography, and more. We will then liaise with digital exchanges, social media platforms, and regulators to access and create an anonymized, open-source, findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable digital footprint database as per our developed framework. We shall also create APIs to ensure that the database is continually updated with minimal intervention.

The database created in this project will allow social science researchers to study how varied social, economic, financial, demographic, and behavioural factors may have contributed to the explosive growth and continued mutual faith in digital assets. It will also help digital exchanges, consumer bodies, policy makers, regulators, and other stakeholder groups with actionable insights to create adequate mechanisms, policies, and strategies to combat fraud. By providing an assessment of the transparency in the crypto sector, a training dataset for autonomous decision models, and reliable and granular data about the social engagements in digital asset trade, our project will contribute to building a more resilient economic system and encourage innovation.

Our project is a vital step forward in understanding the complex landscape of digital assets and cryptocurrencies. By bringing together digital footprint data from various sources, we can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the motivations behind investment decisions, the risks posed by fraudulent actors, and the regulatory environment. With this knowledge, we can work towards building a more transparent, trustworthy, and resilient digital asset market that benefits all stakeholders.

Objectives
Objective 1 (Society): 
The primary objective of this project is to aggregate and organize the user generated digital footprint data produced by transactions of cryptocurrency and digital assets and by social media in order to provide a comprehensive picture of the industry's impact on society. This data includes user activity on various blockchain networks, social media interactions related to crypto, and transaction data from crypto exchanges. By collecting and analysing this data, we can gain insights into how the use of crypto is evolving and impacting society, including how it affects the value of the underlying asset and is changing the way we conduct financial transactions, store value, and interact with one another online. The ultimate goal of this framework and database is to create a better understanding of the potential benefits and risks associated with the use of crypto, and to inform public policy decisions that can help promote its safe and responsible use. 
Achieving this objective will also involve developing open standards that can handle the massive amounts of data generated by the crypto industry and social media. It will also require collaboration with key stakeholders in the industry, including blockchain developers, social media platforms, and crypto exchanges, to ensure that the data is collected and organized in a standardized and secure manner.

Objective 2 (Academic Research):
Our project will create for the first time a systematic, interoperable data framework and a scalable, open-access database on social media interactions, demography, and cryptocurrency/digital assets.  The database will be designed to facilitate easy data exploration, visualization, and analysis, and will provide researchers with the tools and resources they need to conduct sophisticated research on the crypto industry. This will enable future researchers to answer a variety of research questions related to the use and impact of social media on cryptocurrency transaction value and volume. The database can also be used in the future to investigate the impact of various regulatory approaches on the adoption and use of crypto, or explore the potential for crypto to promote financial inclusion and economic growth in developing countries. 

Objective 3 (Industry):
Finally, this project has important implications for the crypto industry itself. One of the biggest challenges facing the industry is a lack of transparency and trustworthiness, which has made it difficult for mainstream consumers and institutions to adopt crypto on a large scale. This framework and database will provide a comprehensive and transparent view of the industry's digital footprint data, map it onto social media data, this this project can help build trust and confidence in the industry, and ultimately promote its wider adoption.
To achieve this goal, we will work closely with industry partners to ensure that the data collected and analysed is accurate, reliable, and representative of the industry as a whole. We will also develop collaborative and robust APIs to ensure continuity of the project. By promoting transparency and trustworthiness in the industry, this project has the potential to drive growth and innovation in the crypto industry and to unlock its full potential for the benefit of society as a whole.",550082,,,"Bid Awaiting Response",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",1,2023-10-01,2024-09-30,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"ESRC ESRC (ECON & SOC RES COUNCIL)","ESRC Default Scheme","Research Councils - ESRC","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"Deliver foundations for a transformation in digital footprint data",,https://www.ukri.org/opportunity/deliver-foundations-for-a-transformation-in-digital-footprint-data/,,"2023-07-20 16:00",500000.00,"2023-06-29 10:08",,"2024-06-28 00:00",,,"Alberto Cossu (AC777)","Ashiq Anjum (AA1180),Navajyoti Samanta (NS595)",,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,,,,"SS/MC: Media & Communication","SE/CM: Computing Sciences,SS/LL: Law","SE/CM: Computing Sciences,SS/LL: Law,SS/MC: Media & Communication","SS/MC: Media & Communication","SE/CM: Computing Sciences,SS/LL: Law","SE/CM: Computing Sciences,SS/LL: Law,SS/MC: Media & Communication",,,,,,"99 - Not Applicable for Institute reporting",,"Sara Mounteney (SLM81)",,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,"EoI/Outline Application (budget required)",,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2023-06-28 19:30",,,,,,,399955.34,399955.34,508774.99,508774.99,499944.17,499944.17,-108819.66,78.61,222242.49,55.57,140873.94,35.22,171037.53,499944.17,0.00,499944.17,0.00,499944.17,177712.84,177712.84,171037.53,499944.17,0.00,499944.17,0.00,499944.17,12500.00,0.00,0.00,109799.55,81368.55,28431.00,0.00,221262.60,0.00,399955.34,399955.34,508774.99,508774.99,499944.17,499944.17,-108819.66,78.61,222242.49,55.57,140873.94,35.22,"2023-10-04 18:17:42",,Discoverable,,"2023-05-11 11:36:09","Alberto Cossu (AC777)","2023-10-06 15:40"

"The landscape of DiabEtes-reLated sTigma in eArly-onset type 2 diabetes in the UK (the DELTA study)",,"Background: Whilst the psychological impact of living with type 2 diabetes (T2D) has been well documented, little attention has been given to the role of diabetes-related stigma which involves judgement for developing diabetes, self-management, and diabetes-related complications. Experience of diabetes-related stigma takes a
physical, psychological and emotional toll on the health of adults living with T2D. Although evidence highlights the negative impact of stigma on people’s self-care and overall well-being, the profile of stigma in younger adults (18-40) with T2D remains understudied. We conducted a series of local Patient and Public involvement (PPI)
group meetings, consisting of young people with T2D (18-40), highlighting a significant need to further explore issues around stigma for adults under the age of 40 years.
Aim: To better understand the experience of stigma in young adults with T2D.
Methods: We propose three mixed-methods exploratory studies involving: 1) Systematic Review; 2) Qualitative
study (interviews with young people living with T2D and Healthcare Professionals); 3) Quantitative study
(Survey).
Dissemination: In peer reviewed medical journal and conference(s). Presentation of findings to local Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) and other appropriate stakeholders. Presentation (written and oral) of findings to study participants and PPI community groups.",545536,,,"Bid Awaiting Response",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",2,2023-10-01,2025-09-30,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"NIHR National Institute of Health Research","Programme Grants for Applied Research (PGfAR)","UK Central Government","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"Stream B Comp 36",,https://www.nihr.ac.uk/documents/programme-development-grants-guidance-for-applying-to-stream-b/29445,,,150000.00,"2023-05-24 10:26",,"2024-05-23 00:00",,,"Michelle Hadjiconstantinou (MH333)","Louise Goff (LW419),Melanie Davies (MJD34),Clare Gillies (CLG13),Sarah Gunn (SG610),Natalie Darko (DD253)","Radhika Chauhan (RC478)","Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,"Deakin University,UHL NHS Trust",,,"LS/HS: Diabetes","Population Health Sciences,Psychology,SS/MC: Sociology","LS/HS: Diabetes,Population Health Sciences,Psychology,SS/MC: Sociology","LS/HS: Diabetes","LS/HS: Population Health Sciences,LS: Psychology,SS/MC: Sociology","LS/HS: Diabetes,LS/HS: Population Health Sciences,LS: Psychology,SS/MC: Sociology",,Yes,,,,"99 - Not Applicable for Institute reporting",,"Vicki Inchley (VLC2)",,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2023-05-23 09:08",,,,,,,149958.19,149958.19,281733.28,281733.28,149958.19,149958.19,-131775.09,53.23,12736.10,8.49,-350.05,-0.23,131728.33,149958.19,0.00,149958.19,0.00,149958.19,137222.09,137222.09,131728.33,149958.19,0.00,149958.19,0.00,149958.19,47569.35,0.00,1200.00,33312.54,13086.14,14288.40,0.00,111198.64,0.00,144020.19,144020.19,275795.28,275795.28,144020.19,144020.19,-131775.09,52.22,6798.10,4.72,-6288.05,-4.37,"2023-10-04 18:15:32",,Discoverable,,"2023-05-02 14:34:09","Radhika Chauhan (RC478)","2023-10-04 18:15"

"A Social Lab for Disclosing Vulnerable People’s ‘Digital Good’",,"The proposed research proposes a pilot Social Lab for exploring vulnerable people’s ‘digital good’. It will do so by examining three broad categories of vulnerable people - older people, ethnic minorities and people with disabilities (PwDs) - via the theoretically informed and empirically innovative study of their digital inclusion. Theoretically, the research proposes a theoretical construct that combines two controversial and seemingly unrelated theoretical approaches: intersectionality theory and Foucault’s social theory. Empirically, this construct will be utilised in the space of a pilot Social Lab where stakeholders and vulnerable people from the three broad categories in focus will engage in 3-staged progress work that will generate an interdisciplinary account of the digital experiences of vulnerable people and the related barriers to, benefits of, as well as tensions and complex dynamics in their relationships with digital technologies.

"Ultra-layered perception with brain-inspired information processing for vehicle collision avoidance (ULTRACEPT)",ULTRACEPT,"This is the existing EU Horizon 2020 project ULTRACEPT transferred to Leicester from Lincoln. 
The project started 1 Dec 2018 is to end 30 Sept 2024. 
ULEIC has taken over as the coordinator as of 15 June 2023.
Lincoln remains on the project.

Subcontract to be issued for Lincoln's project manager Colleen Mitchell  to continue the project manager role.


The primary objective of this project is to develop a trustworthy vehicle collision detection system inspired by animals’ visual brain via trans-institutional collaboration.  Processing multiple modalities sensor data inputs, such as vision and thermal maps with innovative visual brain-inspired algorithms, the project will embrace multidisciplinary and cross-continental academia and industry cooperation in the field of bio-inspired visual neural systems via neural physiological experiments, software simulation, hardware realisation and system integration.  The innovative brain-inspired collision detection system has the advantages of low-cost spatial-temporal and parallel computing capacity of visual neural systems and can be realised in chips specifically for collision detection, both in normal and in complex and/or in extreme environments.

This project brings together 18 world-class research teams and European SMEs each with specialised expertise:

invertebrate visual neuroscientists (UNEW and UBA on the locust and crab),
invertebrate vision modellers (UoL),
cognitive neural system modellers (XJTU, GZHU and GZU),
mixed-signal VLSI chip designers (TU),
experts in hardware/software systems and robotics (UHAM, HUST, TUAT, LNU),
robotics platform provider and market explorer (VISO, DINO),
image signal processing (UPM, NWU), and
brain-inspired pattern recognition expert (CASIA, WWU).
The specifically designed research staff secondments, joint workshops and conferences, will facilitate knowledge transfer between partners and generate significant impact in vehicle collision avoidance research with applications to not only on road safety, but also to other applications such as mobile robots, health care and the video games industry.

"Recycling of Ti Alloy Swarf for Coatings",ReTiCo,"Our concept is to utilise titanium (Ti) alloy swarf (vast amount generated during machining: ~80-90 % of the starting material) to produce the feedstock materials (powder and wires) for processes such as thermal spraying and additive manufacturing. The success of our concept will enable the usage of waste material for the mainstream production of feedstock material and will support the objectives of the current call: sustainability and circular economy. A successful demonstration of the concept will help in the commercialisation of new and efficient manufacturing processes for foundation industries that will, in turn, support the goal of waste recycling - some of the objectives of the current call. The Ti global market is forecasted to grow by a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.5 % from 2023-2030 reaching a market size of ~6.5 billion pounds (8.4 billion USD) in 2029. The major usage (~60%) of Ti alloys is in the aerospace sector and as the UK aerospace industry is the second largest in the world, the requirement of Ti alloys is going to increase in the UK. However, the production of the primary Ti alloy is a highly energy-intensive task that leads to higher costs and higher amounts of carbon footprints. The usage of Ti alloy swarf to generate feedstock material will not only support the production of low-cost Ti alloys for the UK industries but will also support the goal of achieving carbon neutrality (by 2050); by reducing wastage and reducing the usage of energy for material production; hence, supporting the UK economy.

In order to fulfill the goal of collaborative R&D, we have already figured out the industry and academic partners in the UK and India. The success of the project will lead to new and efficient manufacturing processes that will support the goal of sustainability, circular economy, and recyclability of Ti alloys for foundation industries. A successful value-added supply chain from the waste stream will be generated with the success of the current project. The project will generate knowhow and the work will be published in open-access journals.",597529,,,"Bid Awaiting Response",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",2,2024-03-01,2025-08-31,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"INNOVATE UK Innovate UK","INNOVATE UK Default Scheme","UK Central Government","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"India – UK Collaborative R&D for industrial sustainability",,https://apply-for-innovation-funding.service.gov.uk/competition/1561/overview/f3ea8c10-800d-42db-bfef-53d63a86bd2b#summary,,"2023-09-06 11:00",300000.00,"2023-10-04 09:55",,"2024-10-03 00:00",,,"Shiladitya Paul (SP660)",,,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,,,,"SE/EN: TWI Innovation Centre",,"SE/EN: TWI Innovation Centre","SE/EN: TWI Innovation Centre",,"SE/EN: TWI Innovation Centre",,,,,,,INDIA,,"Anna Kardas (AM565)","Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2023-08-29 14:24",,,,,,,126919.87,126919.87,160405.60,160405.60,158649.84,158649.84,-33485.73,79.12,56391.87,44.43,48562.57,38.26,68982.97,158649.84,0.00,158649.84,0.00,158649.84,70528.00,70528.00,68982.97,158649.84,0.00,158649.84,0.00,158649.84,11500.00,2700.00,0.00,28888.54,7829.29,18792.08,2267.18,60989.05,0.00,126919.87,126919.87,160405.60,160405.60,158649.84,158649.84,-33485.73,79.12,56391.87,44.43,48562.57,38.26,"2023-10-04 09:55:58",,Discoverable,,"2023-08-10 18:20:05","Shiladitya Paul (SP660)","2023-10-04 09:55"

"Development of Coatings for Mitigation of Ice Accretion",ICEPHOB,"Ice accretion on surfaces is a serious concern leading to severe environmental and economic losses. It affects myriad of industries, including aviation, telecommunication, naval transport, energy harvesting and distribution, cooling systems, automobiles, etc. [1]. In aircrafts, there is a decrease in drag and at times may lead to dangerous loss of lift force, which may cause tragic crash accidents. For instance, the flight (AF447) from Rio to Paris met with an accident in June 2009 over Atlantic Ocean (killed 228 people) raised a concern towards the safety of human race in air travel. The cause of the mishap was ruled out from any on-board system failures, exception being the sensors (or pitot probes). As per the reports, the pitot probes faced severe icing conditions owing to which the non-flying pilot had to activate the wing anti-icing system, thereby consuming more power for flying.

While most of the studies focus on the macro-scale icing (millimeter-size droplets and bulk ice) some authors have shown promising performance of superhydrophobic laser-textured surfaces against atmospheric icing. The tests have been carried out on wind tunnels and airplane components and it is evident that the ice adhesion is reduced with smaller micrometric droplets. With regard to the deposition methods, spin coating, dip coating, spray coating, Physical Vapour deposition (PVD), Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD), etc. have been developed by the research fraternity for inducing superhydrophobicity. Their advantages are that the deposition parameters can be controlled, and the resulting coating will meet the specifications or required properties when it comes to surface structure, thickness, etc. However, these techniques are not possible to use in the case of upscaling. For real applications, most of the coating systems will behave like paint, and spray coating or brushing are techniques that are mostly used. Smooth surfaces may be the preferred surface structure rather than rough or hierarchical surfaces as their simplicity make them industrially feasible. Thus, the present context of research is a merger of forming hierarchical structures satisfying Cassie Baxter’s equation and then coating the surfaces through spray/dip coating technology. The coatings will be subjected to different characterization techniques, such as wettability, microstructure, topography, composition, tribo-corrosion, and functional studies to assess the icephobic surfaces. The introduction of artificial intelligence aspect for predicting the icephobic coating parameters will be reported. The work will also broaden the scope of incorporating icephobic coatings in large-scale manufacturing industries.",604672,,,"Bid Awaiting Response",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",2,2024-10-01,2026-09-30,,"RF - Research Fellowship",Research,,"CEC CEC","CEC Default Scheme","EU Government Bodies (inc European Commission but not UK)","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"MSCA Postdoctoral Fellowships 2023 [HORIZON-MSCA-2023-PF-01-01]",,https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/calls/msca-postdoctoral-fellowships-2023,,"2023-09-13 16:00",182114.22,"2023-10-04 09:14",,"2024-10-03 00:00",,,"Shiladitya Paul (SP660)",,,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,,,,"SE/EN: Engineering",,"SE/EN: Engineering","SE/EN: Engineering",,"SE/EN: Engineering",,,,,,,,"Anna Kardas (AM565)",,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2023-09-11 15:46",,,,,,"This is a Marie Curie Fellowship Application for Shalini Mohanty.

"Tackling Awarding Gap in Third Year Engineering Individual Project for the Advancement of Ethnic Minority Students - Interventions inspired and informed by students",,"The Higher Education sector has been trying to address Awarding Gap by introducing reforms at university or programme level but so far, HESA figures show very little improvement in the gap.  This project is using a different approach.  We have decided to tackle the problem closer to the root.  We dissected our engineering programmes’ awarding gap down to module level and realised that the biggest contributor to that gap is the third-year individual project; a module that is part of most engineering programmes.
This project is about taking action.  We are implementing changes in the delivery of the third-year project module; changes that have been informed by our BME students’ experiences, by research on inclusive assessments and by best practices in programme directorship.  We will execute a series of tasks as listed in our detailed project plan over the span of 15 months and use the momentum to continue our efforts even after the project has ended.  
Our project outcomes are Enhanced BME Student Learning, Reduced Module Awarding Gap, Socially Responsible Supervisors and Students, Higher Sense of Belonging for BME Students and Improved Confidence to Stay and Progress in Engineering.  We will gather qualitative and quantitative data throughout the project, analyse historical data on progression breaking down BME into Black, Asian, Mixed and Other as well as conduct thorough evaluations for each outcome.
The revelations from this project will benefit all engineering programmes across the sector and adapted lessons would also be applicable to any programme that includes student projects.

"Translating Children’s Literature into Arabic: Textual and Paratextual Framing Strategies","Children’s Literature","This book investigates the development of the translation of children’s literature into Arabic, providing unique insights into the prominent role of Kāmīl Kīlānī in shaping its history as well as for the translation of children’s literature more broadly. The book reflects on Kīlānī’s importance to the translation of Arabic children’s literature as one of the first writers to specialize in adapting works for Arab children, charting his influence through the use of narrative theory and framing strategies in adaptations. The volume encourages cross-cultural understanding and the promotion of reading in minority languages. In particular, it calls attention to translation by adaptation as the main approach in many translations of children’s literature into Arabic and other languages in which cultural differences between source and target languages can prove challenging.",625789,,,"Bid Development",,Pending,"Ahmed Elimam (ASE5),Pre-award Admin",1,2025-01-01,2025-12-31,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"THE LEVERHULME TRUST The Leverhulme Trust","THE LEVERHULME TRUST Default Scheme","UK Charities (Open Competition & External Peer Review)","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"Research Fellowships",,https://www.leverhulme.ac.uk/research-fellowships,,"2023-11-09 16:00",65000.00,,,,,,"Ahmed Elimam (ASE5)",,,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,,,,"SS/AR: Modern Languages",,"SS/AR: Modern Languages","SS/AR: Modern Languages",,"SS/AR: Modern Languages",,,,,,,,,,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3518.04,,3518.04,,3518.04,0.00,100,0.00,0,0.00,0,3518.04,3518.04,0.00,3518.04,0.00,3518.04,3518.04,3518.04,3518.04,3518.04,0.00,3518.04,0.00,3518.04,3518.04,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,3518.04,,3518.04,,3518.04,,0.00,100,0.00,0,0.00,0,"2023-10-03 12:19:21",,Private,,"2023-10-03 11:14:20","Ahmed Elimam (ASE5)","2023-10-10 08:58"

"InvestigAtion into the relAtionship between AortiC aneurysmaL disease and air pOllUtion using Intraoperative samples from live donors and cadaveric organ Donors",AAA-CLOUD,"Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a significant cause of mortality and morbidity, responsible for over 3000 deaths per year in the UK. AAAs are usually asymptomatic until they rupture, an event associated with a mortality of over 80%. Risk of AAA rupture is related to AAA size, with surgery being offered when a AAA reaches a critical threshold size. There are no known strategies to prevent the development or growth of an AAA. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that air pollution kills 7 million people per year worldwide and it is the fourth leading cause of premature death. The role of air pollution in the development of cardiovascular diseases such as AAA is unknown. There is strong evidence that the small particulate component of air pollution plays a key role in pathological processes causing ill health. It is unclear if any of initiation, growth or rupture of AAA may be affected by air pollution exposure. The aim of this project is to investigate the relationships between air pollution and AAA incidence, progression and rupture using toxicological and experimental approaches. The study will involve the collection and laboratory analysis of samples of the aortic wall taking during aneurysm surgery and samples of ‘healthy’ aorta sampled during kidney transplantation to look for evidence of air pollutants in either specimen.",545311,,,"Bid Development",,Pending,"Athanasios Saratzis (AS875),Matthew Bown (MJB42),Pre-award Admin,Sian Baldock (SB850)",5,2023-06-01,2028-05-31,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"VAN GEEST FOUND The John & Lucille Van Geest Foundation","VAN GEEST FOUND Default Scheme","UK Charities (Other Process)","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Matthew Bown (MJB42)","Athanasios Saratzis (AS875)","Sian Baldock (SB850)","Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,,,,"LS: Cardiovascular Sciences",,"LS: Cardiovascular Sciences","LS: Cardiovascular Sciences",,"LS: Cardiovascular Sciences",,,,,,,,,,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.00,,0.00,,0.00,0.00,0,0.00,0,0.00,0,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,,0.00,,0.00,,0.00,0,0.00,0,0.00,0,"2023-10-02 14:37:01",,Private,,"2023-05-02 10:51:25","Liam Musto (LM503)","2023-10-02 14:37"
"Reactive Sulfur Species (RSS) mediate hypoxic oxidative stress and inflammation","RSS mediates hypoxia","Oxygen, a component of the air you breathe, is crucial for your cells to produce energy and carry out various functions. Therefore, the absence of oxygen, or hypoxia, results in many negative outcomes for cells, tissues, and organs. Surprisingly, how hypoxia causes cellular problems is largely unknown. It is especially important to understand how hypoxia affects cells, as hypoxia is linked to many human diseases, such as cancer, cardiovascular and neurological disease as well as the ageing process. In this proposal, we will investigate a novel class of molecules made by cells during episodes of hypoxia. These molecules, collectively called “reactive sulfur species” can have negative consequences to cells and we will determine if these molecules are the primary reason cells function improperly during low oxygen conditions. By understanding the molecular reasons low oxygen is bad for cells, we can then design drugs to limit the effects of hypoxia-related diseases. This would benefit society by preventing or limiting the effects of cancer, heart disease and ageing.",620767,,,"Bid Awaiting Response",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",2,2024-03-01,2025-08-31,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"ROYAL SOCIETY The Royal Society","Research Grants","Research Councils (BEIS) - Roy Society and Brit Academy","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"Research grants",,https://royalsociety.org/grants-schemes-awards/grants/research-grants/,,"2023-10-04 17:00",70000.00,"2023-10-02 14:01",,"2024-10-01 00:00",,,"Christopher Switzer (CS876)",,,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,,,,"LS: Molecular & Cell Biology",,"LS: Molecular & Cell Biology","LS: Molecular & Cell Biology",,"LS: Molecular & Cell Biology",,No,,,,,,"Yusuf Dedat (YD134)",,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2023-09-26 10:29",,,,,,,69998.80,69998.80,184761.17,184761.17,69998.80,69998.80,-114762.37,37.89,0.00,0,-57519.37,-82.17,69998.80,69998.80,0.00,69998.80,0.00,69998.80,69998.80,69998.80,69998.80,69998.80,0.00,69998.80,0.00,69998.80,69998.80,34930.00,32908.80,72211.87,57519.37,13110.75,1581.75,42550.50,0.00,69998.80,69998.80,184761.17,184761.17,69998.80,69998.80,-114762.37,37.89,0.00,0,-57519.37,-82.17,"2023-10-02 14:01:03",,Discoverable,,"2023-09-22 12:59:15","Christopher Switzer (CS876)","2023-10-02 14:01"

"Does sleep disruption affect epigenetic ageing in an insect model?",sleep_epi_ageing,"Ageing is the combination of DNA, cellular and organ damage leading to a decline in function and increased chance of dying. Aging is a complex process influenced by many environmental and genetic components. The effects of these components influence each other making them difficult to investigate, especially in complex mammalian models. Therefore, a large body of ageing research is based on simple model invertebrate organisms. Advantages include easy to keep in a laboratory, short life span, genetic and molecular tools available and a sequenced genome. However, the current models are of little use in the study of epigenetics in ageing.
An epigenetic clock is a better measure of true biological age than chronological age. They are used widely through-out biogerontology. These clocks are based on analyses of the chemical tags called methyl
groups that are found on DNA and help to control gene activity. Current invertebrate models of ageing (Drosophila and C. elegans) do not possess DNA methylation, reducing their generality to understanding human ageing.

Nasonia vitripennis, a tiny wasp and emerging model, has a functional methylation system making it an ideal system to investigate epigenetics of ageing. It possesses all the other advantages of an insect model (see above). The Mallon lab has found it possesses an epigenetic clock.

This project asks does sleep disruption affect epigenetic ageing in an insect model. In general, older people sleep less, wake up and go back to sleep more often, and spend less time in deep sleep or dreaming than younger people. Reciporcally, numerous studies have shown that sleeping too much or too little is associated with mortality among older adults.",507230,,,"Project Setup",Locked,Successful,"Post-award Admin",2,2023-11-06,2025-03-05,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"BBSRC BBSRC BIOTECH.& BIOLOG.SCIENCE",,"Research Councils - BBSRC","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,Pioneer,,https://www.ukri.org/opportunity/pioneer-awards-early-stage-frontier-bioscience-research/,,"2023-03-14 09:20",200000.00,"2023-03-14 09:21",,"2024-03-13 00:00",2023-07-03,,"Eamonn Mallon (EBM3)","Ko-Fan Chen (KC280)",,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,"Imperial College London",,,"LS: Genetics & Genome Biology",,"LS: Genetics & Genome Biology","LS: Genetics & Genome Biology",,"LS: Genetics & Genome Biology",,No,,,,"99 - Not Applicable for Institute reporting",,"Yelena Mazulina (YM41)",,"Post-award Admin (Project Setup)","Post-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,APP3335,,,"Not Applicable for HEBCI","Other public funder (Collaborative)",,"2023-03-14 08:59",,,,,,"Already been costed at preliminary stage",159860.50,164587.00,230652.77,222393.24,199825.62,205733.99,-57806.24,74.01,65505.29,39.8,51529.01,31.31,97692.00,205733.99,0.00,205733.99,0.00,205733.99,99081.71,92389.59,90999.88,205733.99,0.00,205733.99,0.00,205733.99,28389.88,2841.41,0.00,36503.95,13976.28,15905.99,3092.16,86807.58,0.00,153499.19,149089.30,208545.93,217188.77,191875.78,186361.62,-55046.74,73.6,61109.60,39.81,47133.32,30.71,"2023-10-02 11:48:32",,Discoverable,,"2023-02-27 09:14:31","Eamonn Mallon (EBM3)","2023-10-02 11:48"

"Fatherhood in Early Medieval England, AD 600 - 1050",Fathers,"Fatherhood, broadly defined, was a ubiquitous phenomenon in the Early Middle Ages. Many men of all socio-economic statuses would at some point fall into this social category. Fatherhood appears frequently in scripture, and the language of fatherhood was used by secular and religious authorities, notably abbots and popes. Despite the centrality of fatherhood to early medieval life, however, it has received a remarkable lack of scholarly attention.  Increasingly scholars in other fields are recognising the usefulness of fatherhood as a category of analysis, and its potential to reveal new insights into masculinity, gender, socio-economic status, and the foundations of power, yet the early Middle Ages have so far been absent from these historiographical debates. The aim of this project is to address this problem, through an analysis of fatherhood in early medieval Britain and Ireland.

"Understanding and solving mucus dysregulation in severe asthma for better clinical outcomes",,"There is an unmet clinical need in severe asthma patients, who remain uncontrolled and prone to exacerbation even when using maximal existing medication. This leads to adverse impacts in morbidity and mortality. This programme of work aims to provide a major advance in understanding how mucins contribute to severe asthma and will reveal new insight and identify novel therapeutic opportunities for this challenging patient population.

The hypotheses underlying this programme of work are i) mucins make a major contribution to the pathology of severe asthma and offer new therapeutic opportunities, ii) genetic variants in the MUC5AC locus are associated with increased risk of moderate-severe asthma and are functional and alter expression and activity of mucins in the airways, iii) alterations in the levels and biophysical properties of mucins drive structural changes in the airways and lead to severe, uncontrolled asthma and iv) greater mechanistic insight of the molecular and cellular mechanisms regulating mucins, will identify new targets for clinical intervention.",623563,,,"Bid Development",,Pending,"Katherine Fawcett (KAF19),Pre-award Admin",5,2024-09-01,2029-08-31,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"MRC MRC","MRC Default Scheme","Research Councils - MRC","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"Population and systems medicine: responsive mode: programme",,https://www.ukri.org/opportunity/population-and-systems-medicine-programme/,,"2024-01-01 13:35",,,,,,,"Katherine Fawcett (KAF19)",,,"Only people involved in this project",,"University of Nottingham",Yes,,,,,"LS/HS: Population Health Sciences",,"LS/HS: Population Health Sciences","LS/HS: Population Health Sciences",,"LS/HS: Population Health Sciences",,,,,,"99 - Not Applicable for Institute reporting",,,,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,640976.14,,829299.29,,801220.17,-188323.15,77.29,291617.62,45.5,183300.60,28.6,328264.42,801220.17,0.00,801220.17,0.00,801220.17,349358.52,349358.52,328264.42,801220.17,0.00,801220.17,0.00,801220.17,55748.00,32400.00,1348.00,150631.42,108317.02,42314.40,0.00,329309.35,0.00,640976.14,,829299.29,,801220.17,,-188323.15,77.29,291617.62,45.5,183300.60,28.6,"2023-09-28 14:04:35",,Private,,"2023-09-28 12:42:54","Katherine Fawcett (KAF19)","2023-10-05 09:43"

"Adult and Community-Based Learning in Rural Uganda: Introducing a Mother Tongue Language and Basic Entrepreneurship Programme",MTL/BE,"This project focuses on Adult Learning and Education (ALE) and community-based learning in Uganda, a country whose education system and regulatory policies favour formal education. ALE presents opportunities for lifelong learning, which equips adults with literacy and basic skills and to become active citizens through community education (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization/UNESCO, 2006, 2015). 
We hypothesise that MT languages are effective mediums of instruction in the delivery of ALE and community-based learning in rural SSA. Accordingly, we propose to develop and implement a Mother Tongue Language and Basic Entrepreneurship (MTL/BE) programme to tackle the learning challenges. 
Focusing on two languages (Ateso and Lusoga) that are among the nine approved MTs used as mediums of instruction in Uganda, the project will involve interlinked Learning and Action Research components. The communities of interest are: Kumi (Ateso-speaking) and Busesa (Lusoga-speaking). 
We theorise that a hybridity of learning approaches is paramount in enhancing learning in rural communities. Through our partnership with LABE (Literacy and Adult Basic Education), the leading provider of MT-ALE in Uganda, we will introduce Home Learning Centres (HLCs) to concurrently deliver intergenerational learning programs.",545726,,,"Bid Awaiting Response",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",3,2024-09-01,2027-08-31,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"ESRC ESRC (ECON & SOC RES COUNCIL)","ESRC Default Scheme","Research Councils - ESRC","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"ESRC responsive mode research grant round one",,https://www.ukri.org/opportunity/esrc-responsive-mode-research-grant-round-one/,,"2023-09-28 16:00",1000000.00,"2023-09-28 10:12",,"2024-09-27 00:00",,,"Winfred Onyas (MWIO1)",,,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,"Partner not Listed","Partner not Listed",,"SS/BU: M'ing, Innov', Str'gy & Ops, Dept",,"SS/BU: M'ing, Innov', Str'gy & Ops, Dept","SS/BU: M'ing, Innov', Str'gy & Ops, Dept",,"SS/BU: M'ing, Innov', Str'gy & Ops, Dept",,,,,,,,,,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2023-09-15 11:35",,,,,,,537447.07,537447.07,676942.71,676942.71,662819.84,662819.84,-139495.64,79.39,134125.10,24.96,50117.96,9.33,431141.52,662819.84,0.00,662819.84,0.00,662819.84,403321.97,403321.97,395185.52,662819.84,0.00,662819.84,0.00,662819.84,290295.83,43253.00,0.00,101503.14,84007.14,17496.00,0.00,136161.60,35956.00,501491.07,501491.07,640986.71,640986.71,626863.84,626863.84,-139495.64,78.24,98169.10,19.58,14161.96,2.82,"2023-09-28 10:12:39",,Private,,"2023-05-02 15:44:23","Winfred Onyas (MWIO1)","2023-10-02 12:22"

"Innovative packaging solutions for AI-driven clinical decision support tools","ipso facto","Better use of information and data in the NHS is critical for realizing significant improvements in clinical care and delivery. One area where this is important is using data to build computer-based clinical decision support tools to help healthcare workers make smarter decisions about patients. There is a growing interest in building such tools around Artificial Intelligence (AI) models. These AI models are trained to recognise patterns in data which allow them to make specific predictions when presented with new data about a patient. However, to be of practical use AI models need to be embedded into a clinical decision support tool - this provides the features required for the AI model to be used in practice. While the number of AI models and tools being developed is increasing rapidly, the number being used in practice remains modest.

A major reason for the lack of uptake is the cost and complexity of developing, evaluating and setting up such tools. This includes initially creating and testing an AI model and the clinical decision support tool in the first place. Then undertaking clinical trials - highly-structured, onerous and time consuming regulatory assessments which are required to determine how effective the tool is. The final stage is linking the tool together with real-life computer systems which provide the health data required for them to be used in the clinic.
 
In this project I aim to produce a modular technology for creating clinical decision support tools as customisable, re-usable and adaptable “packages” which can integrate AI models. This will simplify the development and implementation of these AI-based tools and expedite their use in clinical practice. To achieve this I will:

1)	Develop a secure CDS packaging framework which allows packages to be defined from a set of re-usable modules supporting predictive algorithms and AI models. A key strength will be the ability to switch the input and output modules to support data sources and features required for different development stages (research, testing, validation, clinical trials and implementation).
2)	Enhance the packaging technology with safe and responsible approaches for handling integrated AI models, to ensure packages are working correctly and include support for displaying appropriate information to healthcare workers to allow them to understand why and how the predictions are being made.
3)	Evaluate the technology by demonstrating its effectiveness for the entire process of clinical model development from initial evaluation, through a mock clinical trial and test implementation with existing information systems.

To achieve these objectives, my team and I will build on my own and others’ research and tools and collaborate with clinical and technical experts using both simulated and real-world data and computer systems to achieve our aims. Through a co-design approach we will develop and evaluate the exemplar project to test the effectiveness of the approach.

"Laser-based measurement for multi-physical parameter distribution in combustion field",,"A clear, reliable, and efficient aviation jet engine is desirable for safety, environmental protection, and accomplishing the UK’s long-term carbon reduction target. Key to achieving such an engine is developing a technique that could enable engineers to monitor everything going on in the engine’s combustion chamber. This sounds straightforward: the chemical reaction between the fuel and oxygen in the combustion chamber provides the driving power for the engine and constantly converts the chemical energy of the fuel into the heat/internal energy of the gas mixture which propels the engine. However, in practice, the process is extremely complex and difficult to monitor. In the combustion chamber, the liquid fuel undergoes a complicated process including spraying, evaporation, and combustion in a high-pressure, turbulent environment. Multiple quantities such as temperature, flow velocity, and chemical species concentration need to be measured to construct a full picture of the complex combustion process. Moreover, the delicate process is extremely fast with each step taking place within milliseconds and is very easily disturbed, so a quick response, real-time, and non-intrusive laser-based optical measurement method is the most promising candidate for realising the simultaneous measurement of the physical quantities mentioned above. This study aims to explore the possibility and advantages of combining three novel laser diagnostics techniques as a method to measure multiple physical quantities at the same time without disturbing the combustion process. Therefore, this project stands to benefit both research into in-chamber combustion and the UK’s efforts to develop more environmentally friendly aviation.",622361,,,"Bid Awaiting Response",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",2,2024-03-10,2026-03-09,,"RV - Research Travel Only",Research,,"ROYAL SOCIETY The Royal Society",,"Research Councils (BEIS) - Roy Society and Brit Academy","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"International Exchanges Scheme – Cost Share Programme 2023",,https://royalsociety.org/-/media/grants-schemes-awards/grants/international-exchanges/International_Exchanges_Cost_Share_Programme_Scheme_Notes.pdf,,"2023-09-27 15:00",,"2023-09-27 13:00",,"2024-09-26 00:00",,,"Bo Tian (BT156)",,,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,,,,"SE/EN: Engineering",,"SE/EN: Engineering","SE/EN: Engineering",,"SE/EN: Engineering",,,,,,,,"Anna Kardas (AM565)",,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2023-09-27 11:39",,,,,,,12000.00,12000.00,12000.00,12000.00,12000.00,12000.00,0.00,100,0.00,0,0.00,0,12000.00,12000.00,0.00,12000.00,0.00,12000.00,12000.00,12000.00,12000.00,12000.00,0.00,12000.00,0.00,12000.00,12000.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,12000.00,12000.00,12000.00,12000.00,12000.00,12000.00,0.00,100,0.00,0,0.00,0,"2023-09-27 13:00:05",,Discoverable,,"2023-09-26 16:02:34","Bo Tian (BT156)","2023-09-27 13:00"

"Genetic basis of the evolution of insect hearing",EvoEar,"Insects have evolved auditory organs (ears) at least 19 separate times. All insect ears evolved from stretch-sensitive proprioceptors (joint-angle sensitive receptors) as the cell types are very similar. My research ambition is to understand how unique ear evolution is across insect orders and to establish the genetic scaffold on which ear specialisations evolved. This international exchange will allow me to interact with an emerging expert in cicada biology, Prof. Eberl (University of Iowa) and, with him, collect auditory organs and proprioceptive organs from cicadas during a dual emergence in the spring of 2024 in the field. Cicadas represent a unique order (Hemiptera), that I do not have access to in the UK, and will complement my RNA sequencing data from my two lab-based orders (Orthoptera and Diptera). I will travel to the cicada sites of emergence (Eastern Iowa) and collect cicadas and extract cicada auditory organs and cicada femoral chordotonal (proprioceptive) organ on liquid nitrogen. At least 100 individuals are required to extract enough biological material for RNA extraction and the emergence of millions of cicadas in spring 2024 is a unique opportunity to acquire this unique biological dataset. Biological material will then be transported by to the University of Iowa on dry ice for RNA extraction, before shipping the extracted RNA for sequencing.",616839,,,"Bid Awaiting Response",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",1,2024-03-01,2025-02-28,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"ROYAL SOCIETY The Royal Society",,"Research Councils (BEIS) - Roy Society and Brit Academy","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"International Exchanges Scheme Standard Programme 2023 – Round 3",,https://royalsociety.org/grants-schemes-awards/grants/international-exchanges/,,"2023-09-27 15:00",6000.00,"2023-09-27 09:50",,"2024-09-26 00:00",,,"Benjamin Warren (BW120)",,,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,,,,"LS: Neuroscience, Psychology & Behaviour",,"LS: Neuroscience, Psychology & Behaviour","LS: Neuroscience, Psychology & Behaviour",,"LS: Neuroscience, Psychology & Behaviour",,,,,,,,"William Hudson (WOH3)",,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2023-09-26 13:06",,,,,,"This is a small international exchanges research travel fund.

"Large Language Models as Creativity Evaluation Judges for Inclusive Design in Cultural Spaces",,"Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have been recently in the news surprising people with its ability to mimic human conversations. More than that, they can explain programming code and do creative tasks such as writing song lyrics and poetry. In the field of Computational Creativity (CC), creative artefacts generated solely by machine or co-created with humans, such as stories and artworks, are considered creative if they present novelty (e.g., new compared to the existing ones) and value (e.g., aesthetic pleasing for artworks). There are two main strategies to evaluate creative artefacts: evaluation metrics and human judges. Evaluation metrics are commonly used to automatically guide creative systems towards creative candidate artefacts with high value and novelty. Then, the most creative ones are evaluated by humans, since they are the only reliable judges on creativity. This current approach poses some limitations in the research field and also in its applications: creative artefacts produced by CC-systems are rarely compared under the same criteria, human judges and benchmarks; creative professionals from cultural spaces cannot rely on traditional evaluation metrics to get feedback on their co-created artefacts during the design phase of museum exhibitions; most automatic CC-systems rely on creativity evaluation from a single perspective dictated by traditional evaluation metrics which might produce biased, non-inclusive and even non-creative artefacts.

I have been doing research in creativity evaluation since 2016, by proposing new metrics to guide generation and evaluation of value and novelty of creative artefacts, such as culinary recipes and digital games cards. My current pioneering research achieved promising results showing that GPT-4, the most advanced LLM to date, is able to evaluate creativity in two common creativity tests, the Alternative Uses Test and an adaptation of the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking (TTCT) for textual descriptions of images. In another study, I have showed that GPT-4 evaluation of jokes funniness has a positive correlation with non-expert human judges using a novel many-shot prompting to generate representative personality descriptions which in turn are used to configure the model to mimic the score rating by human judges. In another study with collaborators, we showed that GPT-4 is able to distinguish different poetry author styles by fine-tuning the GPT-3 model. 

My research hypothesis is that LLMs can act as an audience of human judges with multiple perspective views for the evaluation of creativity, for which creativity could otherwise only be reliably evaluated by a real audience of human judges. The main objectives of this project are: O1) To investigate and understand the reliability and limitations of LLMs in the creativity evaluation of artefacts; O2) To determine methods to create an audience of human judges with LLMs; and O3) To develop and test a framework to provide means to explore the collaboration between creative professionals from cultural spaces and LLM audiences to improve the evaluation of creative artefacts.

This project can significantly benefit the CC research community and creative professionals, in particular multi-modal cultural space ones such as museums designers and curators, by enabling real-time feedback, increasing productivity, faster design of creative artefacts and reducing biases in the co-created artefacts. Also, the novel proposed framework will predict creative artefact success to customized audiences, support inclusive design and provide a standard reference benchmark for CC researchers, accelerating progress in this research field.",610139,,,"Bid Awaiting Response",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",3,2024-07-01,2027-06-30,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"EPSRC EPSRC ENG.& PHYS.SCIENCES R C","EPSRC Default Scheme","Research Councils - EPSRC","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"EPSRC new investigator award: responsive mode",,https://www.ukri.org/opportunity/epsrc-responsive-mode-new-investigator-awards/,,"2023-09-28 16:00",,"2023-09-26 14:44",,"2024-09-25 00:00",,,"Fabrício Góes (LFWG1)",,,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,,,,"SE/CM: Computing Sciences",,"SE/CM: Computing Sciences","SE/CM: Computing Sciences",,"SE/CM: Computing Sciences",,,,,,,,"Anna Kardas (AM565)",,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2023-09-22 13:50",,,,,,None.,340849.27,340849.27,440671.39,440671.39,426061.58,426061.58,-99822.13,77.35,149298.56,43.8,98652.27,28.94,180280.93,426061.58,0.00,426061.58,0.00,426061.58,191550.71,191550.71,180280.93,426061.58,0.00,426061.58,0.00,426061.58,37400.00,20000.00,0.00,73245.29,50646.29,22599.00,0.00,175875.40,0.00,340849.27,340849.27,440671.39,440671.39,426061.58,426061.58,-99822.13,77.35,149298.56,43.8,98652.27,28.94,"2023-09-26 14:44:29",,Discoverable,,"2023-09-06 14:02:13","Fabrício Góes (LFWG1)","2023-09-26 14:44"

"Bridging Cultures: People, Places, Peace and Prosperity",,"Buoyed by commitment and enthusiasm from the then world leaders, the United Nations (UN) was established to ‘reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small’, ‘to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom’, ‘to establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law can be maintained’ and ‘to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war’ (UN Charter, Preamble). People, places, peace and prosperity were central to the new UN in 1945, and reconfirmed repeatedly thereafter, not least in the 2015 roadmap for the organisation moving forward, Agenda 2030 and the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Yet, the world is increasingly fragmenting, with conflicts, a rising number of authoritarian and autocratic governments, and global challenges including pandemics, food and energy supplies, global supply chain shifts and the climate emergency heightening insecurity.

Whilst most of these issues are, to some extent, considered in academic literature and in reports of international organisation and civil society organisations, this network plus aims to evaluate the current understanding then advance knowledge through crossing disciplinary boundaries and using a wide range of research methods and collaboration. The aim is to determine how the rising influence and power of China and Russia can be harnessed to promote stronger international cooperation, within the current multilateral architecture, focussed on addressing the growing number of international challenges impacting on people, places, peace and prosperity.

Engaging with researchers and practitioners from key states as well as those with indepth country knowledge then fostering new links with researchers with thematic expertise will expand and deepen understanding of theoretical models and the practical application of law and policy in different legal, political, economic, social and cultural environments. Drawing on national and international researchers also contributes towards the agility of the projects building inherent flexibility in the approach.

To understand the context, impact and opportunities, the objectives are

1. Developing understanding of the cultural, economic, political and social determinants shaping and influencing approaches of China and Russia to international law and policy;

2. Mapping their transnational influence on aspects of the international rule of law, governance and cooperation, the form it takes and how governments in East and Pacific Asia, Eastern Europe and Eurasia respond;

3. Analysing the disconnection and tension between these new approaches and the traditional structures and modalities of international governance epitomised by the UN;

4. Identifying practical pathways to strengthen positively the responsibility that comes with emergent global power; and

5. Drawing together findings to articulate a framework for productive international cooperation strengthening international human rights and development.

These objectives are ambitious, yet realistic given the wide range of networks and contacts of the core team and partners. Key is drawing on national perspectives and insights from those familiar with the local (national or UN) approaches, national insights are often missing from English language literature, fortifying claims that the UN or western/developed states do not understand the national situation, the national characteristics of law or are not familiar with local conditions impacting on the realisation of human rights.
Delivering on these objectives will offer empirically based, culturally sensitive and realistic insights into aspects of the global power shifts which impact on people and their rights, peace and security of place and prosperity of all. The findings can be used by policy makers shaping interventions on the international stage, researchers across disciplines and civil society.",620077,,,"Bid Submission",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",4,2024-04-01,2028-03-31,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"ESRC ESRC (ECON & SOC RES COUNCIL)","ESRC Default Scheme","Research Councils - ESRC","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"Polarities and Regions Network Plus",,https://www.ukri.org/opportunity/polarities-and-regions-network-plus/,,"2023-10-12 11:05",5000000.00,,,,,,"Nauman Reayat (NR210)",,,"Only people involved in this project",,"University of Newcastle-upon-Tyne",Yes,,,,,"SS/LL: Law",,"SS/LL: Law","SS/LL: Law",,"SS/LL: Law",,,,,,"99 - Not Applicable for Institute reporting",,"Ellen Puurman (EP258)",,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,Law,,,,,,,"2023-09-26 14:11",,,,,,"This is to make a correction that the Principal investigator is Prof Rhona Smith, School of Law, Newcastle University.

"Synthesis of Mercury's crustal compositions for evaluation of BepiColombo exploration","Synthesis of Mercury's crust","Data for the surface of Mercury indicates a rocky surface with compositions unlike any on Earth. The planet appears to be a highly reduced (without oxygen) environment, with incredibly low FeO content (<~2 vs <14 wt % on Earth), despite an iron core that makes up ~85% of the planet. Enigmatic areas of high C are thought to have potentially formed during an early magma ocean stage, producing a graphite flotation crust. All in all, of only 4 terrestrial planets in the Solar System to understand, Mercury doesn’t fit the model set by the other three. 

No samples of Mercury have come to Earth as a meteorite, due to the proximity of Mercury to the Sun. And without the means to access materials here on Earth, quite like those on Mercury, simple observations such as mineralogy, grain size, scale of heterogeneity, or abundance of volatile elements, are hard to constrain. Lab testing and processing capability of instruments onboard the ESA-JAXA BepiColombo mission are currently being ground-tested in lab-based facilities, in preparation for the arrival in orbit around Mercury in late 2025. Without materials analogous to those likely to be encountered on the surface of the planet, measurements and spectra could be processed wrongly, leading to erroneous interpretations.

In a novel approach to examine the mineralogy and physical properties of the surface of Mercury, we propose to synthesize samples that match the major element chemistry extrapolated from the previous mission to Mercury (2011-2015 MESSENGER data).

"EASYSENS: Imprinted Polymers as a Sensing Platform for Clinical and Forensic Analysis",EASYSENS,"The availability of the effective analytical tools is an important prerequisite for a successful delivery of the healthcare, environment, security and a food safety missions.
Currently, biosensors play a key role in addressing the analytical challenges, however, despite considerable efforts, biosensors remain unavailable for many important applications due to the high price and poor stability of the biological components used in such devices. In an ideal world, recognition components used in biosensors would be robust, inexpensive, sensitive to relevant targets, capable of generating a sensor response, and suitable for integration with inexpensive and robust transducers. Since, neither enzymes nor antibodies are fully capable of meeting these expectations, the search began decades ago for synthetic alternatives to biological molecules, such as molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs). 
The major breakthrough made by my team in the last five years in relation to the design and production of “monoclonal” robust MIPs as an alternative to enzymes and antibodies for sensor applications, has made it possible to consider the practical application of such devices. 
The aim of the proposed research is to revolutionise diagnostics by developing a new generation of completely abiotic, robust, easy to use and inexpensive sensors that explore the full potential of nanoMIPs as high-performance supramolecular receptors with integrated binding and signal generation.
By bringing together the modelling, nanotechnology and engineering expertise of my team, this vision could be delivered by addressing three high-impact scientific objectives. Objective one will include a development of the generic platform technology for creating MIP nanoparticles (nanoMIPs) specific for the important clinical and forensic target analytes and capable of recognising them in complex environments. Second objective will focus on a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms by which MIPs generate signals during interaction with analytes and use this understanding to create polymers with integrated binding, electron transduction and signalling functionalities. Objective three will include a development of printing technology for integrating nanoMIPs with electrochemical sensors.
The knowledge and protocols developed during the project will advance scientific methods, theory and applications across many disciplines beyond molecular imprinting. A key impact will be to make the use of animals for the production of antibodies obsolete. New effective and affordable sensors will improve the quality of life, health and safety of our citizens and change the way we conduct clinical testing, administer and monitor drugs, police our streets and protect our society.",518897,,,"Bid Awaiting Response",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",5,2024-07-01,2029-06-30,,"RF - Research Fellowship",Research,,"EPSRC EPSRC ENG.& PHYS.SCIENCES R C","EPSRC Default Scheme","Research Councils - EPSRC","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"EPSRC open fellowship",,https://www.ukri.org/opportunity/epsrc-open-fellowship/,,"2023-09-28 16:00",,"2023-09-26 13:41",,"2024-09-25 00:00",,,"Elena Piletska (EP219)",,,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,,,,"SE/CH: Chemical Biology",,"SE/CH: Chemical Biology","SE/CH: Chemical Biology",,"SE/CH: Chemical Biology",,,,,,"99 - Not Applicable for Institute reporting",,"Sara Mounteney (SLM81)",,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2023-09-21 16:23",,,,,,,1991851.77,1991851.77,2608997.40,2608997.40,2489814.71,2489814.71,-617145.63,76.35,527714.37,26.49,527714.37,26.49,1344954.71,2489814.71,0.00,2489814.71,0.00,2489814.71,1464137.40,1464137.40,1344954.71,2489814.71,0.00,2489814.71,0.00,2489814.71,273998.80,72000.00,186998.80,293850.00,0.00,262215.00,31635.00,851010.00,0.00,1991851.77,1991851.77,2608997.40,2608997.40,2489814.71,2489814.71,-617145.63,76.35,527714.37,26.49,527714.37,26.49,"2023-09-26 13:41:53",,Discoverable,,"2023-03-13 10:22:43","Elena Piletska (EP219)","2023-09-26 13:42"

"Right place, right practitioner, right time: development of emergency department triage to support the identification and management of drug related problems",DRP-EDiT,"About one third of people who visit A&E have a problem with their medicines. These medicines have been
prescribed by their GP or bought from a pharmacy/shop. For example, patients may have side effects that make
them feel unwell, like stomach upset, while other people feel their medicine may not be working and want to
try something else. In these examples, the people may be aware that they have a problem with their medicine,
but sometimes people may not even know their medicines are the cause of the problem. For example,
someone could visit A&E with bad stomach ache and not realise the ibuprofen tablets they have been taking
regularly could be the cause of a stomach ulcer. Sometimes, the healthcare professionals working in A&E might
not even realise that medicine might be the cause the problem! Asking questions about the medicines people
are taking is often missed when patients speak to a nurse or doctor because they are more concerned with the
problem at hand. This means that problems with patient’s medicines may not be resolved during their visit to
A&E and patients may have to put up with the problem and suffer longer. The first part of this project will help
A&E staff find any problems that patients might have with their medicines.
If a problem with a patient’s medicine is found then the problem should be fixed by a healthcare professional
who is an expert in medicine. This could be a doctor or nurse, but a pharmacist who works in A&E might be the
best person to help. Pharmacists do not usually work in A&E, but there are at least 20 hospitals across the UK
that do have one. They help with all things that involve medicines, for example, looking over doctor’s
prescriptions to check they are safe, or helping nurses understand how to give medicines to a person with
swallowing problems. While we know that pharmacists are experts in medicines, we do not yet know which
patients could benefit most from a pharmacist helping to care for them. The second and final part of this
project will help to make sure that patients who have a problem with their medicines are helped by
pharmacists.
For the project, we will talk to doctors, nurses and pharmacists in A&E to get their views on what would be a
good way to find patients who have problems with medicines, and how to ensure these patients get the best

"Resolving the Paradox of Stable and Accurate AI",StableAI,"According to National AI Strategy, AI is expected to transform the UK's economic landscape, improve people's lives and public services, and radically change industries. Modern AI technologies, paired with today's unprecedented availability of data and computational resources demonstrate exceptional capabilities across sectors. Most of this progress, however, has been made within a subclass of weak AI, including state-of-the-art deep learning models. Despite these technologies demonstrate great success in applications, they remain far from general AI. A general AI should be able to reliably learn any task that a human can.

An important barrier on the road to general AI, however, is the inability of the current deep learning methodology to guarantee that the neural networks it produces are both accurate and stable. Instability here means that small changes in the training data may result in unexpected and potentially undesired outcomes. 

In September 2021 Bastounis et al. proved that for any AI implemented by a neural network with fixed architecture, there are infinitely many tasks on which that network fails in the presence of arbitrarily small data perturbations. This phenomenon was shown to be fundamentally unavoidable, and cannot be overcome by better data or training. This barrier is extremely novel and it is not yet known if it can be overcome.

In this project, we will approach this key challenge by establishing a new theory underpinning the development a new class of AI models that can continuously adapt their architecture and keep learning with provable performance gains, completely avoiding the curse of AI instability. Our recent work reveals an unexpected approach capitalising on high dimensionality of modern AI systems. We will explore these new findings in their highest generality, with dependencies and guarantees of continuous learning, resolving the stability-accuracy paradox and paving the way for the general AI. As a part of the project's delivery, we will explore the application of the new theory in strategic UK sectors such as healthcare (with Trauma Audit Research Network \& NIHR Biomedical Research Centre Leicester), smart materials (Tangi 0), and security (Synoptix).

The theory and technology developed in our project will transform AI technologies by resolving the recently discovered stability-accuracy paradox imposing an imminent foundational barrier which limits the application of existing AI. Successful resolution of the paradox will enable creation of new AI systems which can reliably learn from vast amounts of knowledge that has already been accumulated in texts and documents produced by humanity.",585894,,,"Bid Awaiting Response",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",3,2024-09-01,2027-08-31,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"EPSRC EPSRC ENG.& PHYS.SCIENCES R C","EPSRC Default Scheme","Research Councils - EPSRC","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"EPSRC standard research grant, May 2023: responsive mode",,https://www.ukri.org/opportunity/epsrc-responsive-mode-standard-research-grant/,,"2023-09-28 16:00",,"2023-09-26 11:32",,"2024-09-25 00:00",,,"Bogdan Grechuk (BG83)",,,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,"King's College London,University of Cambridge,University of Sheffield",,,,"SE/CM: Mathematical Sciences",,"SE/CM: Mathematical Sciences","SE/CM: Mathematical Sciences",,"SE/CM: Mathematical Sciences",,,,,,,,"Anna Kardas (AM565)",,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,"Full Application",,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2023-09-22 10:26",,,,,,,926625.09,926625.09,1174935.46,1174935.46,1158281.36,1158281.36,-248310.37,78.87,561319.51,60.58,498597.48,53.81,353126.93,1158281.36,0.00,1158281.36,0.00,1158281.36,365305.58,198059.58,185880.93,1158281.36,0.00,1158281.36,0.00,1158281.36,43000.00,3000.00,0.00,359855.53,62722.03,56813.25,6854.25,449774.35,0.00,393744.41,393744.41,508834.61,508834.61,492180.51,492180.51,-115090.20,77.38,195684.83,49.7,132962.80,33.77,"2023-09-26 11:32:14",,Discoverable,,"2023-07-18 11:50:50","Bogdan Grechuk (BG83)","2023-10-11 14:20"

"Investigation of uranium occurrence in sedimentary phosphorite using synchrotron-X-rays",,"Royal society  Cost share programme aimed to support two researchers in collaborative research between UK and China. 
Abstract
Phosphate fertilisers used to enhance agricultural crop productively are commonly derived from phosphorite ore. China is one of the largest producers of phosphorite. Problematically, some global ores contain uranium (U), thereby rendering the extracted fertiliser undesirable. Where applied to crops or grass, U might accumulate in the soil, be consumed by grazing animals or leach into rivers that supply drinking water [1], thereby posing a threat to human health. Whilst natural U, as U-238, is mildly radioactivity, its radioactive decay products such as radon are more active. Uranium is toxic and affects the kidneys [2]. Such health threats have been identified as significant in the US [3]. Solving this problem requires the separation of U from phosphorite, yet little is known about phosphorite geochemistry. Uranium may reside within the ore, either bonded to phosphate or adsorbed to iron-rich minerals. Solving this quandary will help determine the most effective separation approach. Standard laboratory equipment can reveal a lot about an ore’s geochemistry, but using powerful synchrotron X-rays can reveal much more detail about how U is atomically bonded and spatially distributed. Collaboratively, though this proposal, and a parallel application for beamtime at the Diamond light source (DLS), the UK’s synchrotron facility, Cumberland and Zhang, aim to synergise their expertise in uranium geochemistry, ore geology and analytical techniques, and to analysis phosphorite samples from China. The potential benefits are enormous as this research can lead to safer fertiliser, uranium for low-carbon nuclear energy and valuable insights into environmental cleanup.",611963,,,"Bid Awaiting Response",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",2,2024-03-31,2026-03-30,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"ROYAL SOCIETY The Royal Society","Research Grants","Research Councils (BEIS) - Roy Society and Brit Academy","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"International Exchanges 2023 Cost Share (NSFC)",,https://royalsociety.org/grants-schemes-awards/grants/international-exchanges/,,"2023-09-27 15:35",12000.00,"2023-09-26 10:45",,"2024-09-25 00:00",,,"Susan Cumberland (SAC85)",,,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,"Partner not Listed",,,,"SE/GE: Geology",,"SE/GE: Geology","SE/GE: Geology",,"SE/GE: Geology",,,,,,,,"Gary Mawby (GM276)",,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2023-09-25 10:15",,,,,,"Export  reference- CSE-23-10 - Synchrotron DLS",12000.00,12000.00,12000.00,12000.00,12000.00,12000.00,0.00,100,0.00,0,0.00,0,12000.00,12000.00,0.00,12000.00,0.00,12000.00,12000.00,12000.00,12000.00,12000.00,0.00,12000.00,0.00,12000.00,12000.00,2980.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,12000.00,12000.00,12000.00,12000.00,12000.00,12000.00,0.00,100,0.00,0,0.00,0,"2023-09-26 10:45:12",,Private,,"2023-09-08 15:32:06","Susan Cumberland (SAC85)","2023-09-27 10:44"

"Public opinion and the ‘Apostasy’ in Greece: The Centre Union party and the resignation of Georgios Papandreou in the July 1965 constitutional crisis",,"The legislative elections of November 1963 and February 1964 were important for Greece, bringing to power the Centre Union party under the leadership of Georgios Papandreou after sustained centre-right government. But Papandreou left office in July 1965 amid political and constitutional acrimony, with continuing instability leading to authoritarian rule by a military junta between 1967-74. There has been no scholarly research into the responses of the public at this time of meaningful change in the Greek political system. This project will analyse an untapped collection of survey datasets from 1964-66 to analyse public opinion in Athens. The project will shed new light on evaluations of Papandreou’s leadership and the Centre Union government, a party with a strong appeal to the urban electorate. The project would make a major contribution to the study of the pre-junta period and to the wider literatures on party politics and voting behaviour in Greece.",545799,RS30W545799,,"Project Live",Locked,Successful,"Ben Clements (BC101),Post-award Admin,Pre-award Admin",1,2023-10-01,2024-09-30,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"BRITISH ACADEMY The British Academy","BA/Leverhulme Small Research Grants","Research Councils (BEIS) - Roy Society and Brit Academy","T3 - 20% VAT on Expenditure - not recoverable,Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"BA/Leverhulme Small Research Grants",,https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/funding/ba-leverhulme-small-research-grants/,,"2023-05-31 17:00",10000.00,"2023-05-31 09:56",,"2024-05-30 00:00",2023-08-31,,"Ben Clements (BC101)",,,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,"Durham University",,,,"SS/HP: Politics & International Relation",,"SS/HP: Politics & International Relation","SS/HP: Politics & International Relation",,"SS/HP: Politics & International Relation",,,,,,"99 - Not Applicable for Institute reporting",GREECE,"Ellen Puurman (EP258)","Daksha Patel (DP230)","Post-award Admin (Project Setup)","Post-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Politics & international studies",SRG23\230931,"10 - Automatic payment by Funder - Actual Costs",,,,,"2023-05-24 10:47",,,,,,,10000.00,10000.00,25571.74,25571.74,10000.00,10000.00,-15571.74,39.11,0.00,0,-9169.34,-91.69,10000.00,10000.00,0.00,10000.00,0.00,10000.00,10000.00,10000.00,10000.00,10000.00,0.00,10000.00,0.00,10000.00,10000.00,10000.00,0.00,9898.35,9169.35,729.00,0.00,5673.40,0.00,10000.00,10000.00,25571.74,25571.74,10000.00,10000.00,-15571.74,39.11,0.00,0,-9169.34,-91.69,"2023-09-25 16:50:49",,Discoverable,,"2023-05-02 16:19:33","Ben Clements (BC101)","2023-09-29 11:42"

To achieve these objectives, a qualitative study constituting of in-depth interviews with  Roma
consumers, pro-Roma activists and NGOs members, and  marketing and communication practitioners will be conducted.

"Towards a new power infrastructure development path for rural Africa",PowerPath,"To tackle climate change and meet the increasing power needs efficiently by 2030, clean power is the most affordable and reliable option for all countries and especially the developing. The Breakthrough Agenda (Gov.uk, January 2022) however, declares the ambition of the COP26 world leaders to go beyond tackling climate change alone. The goal is to catalyse the growth of markets, jobs and economic development globally for clean technologies and sustainable solutions, support the achievement of the UN Sustainable Development Goals, strengthen the climate resilience of societies and realise multiple co-benefits such as cleaner air, water and better health.

One of the key metrics in the realisation of this agenda is providing evidence that power systems can integrate very high levels of variable renewable energy (including up to 100%) in different geographies and climates whilst maintaining a cost-efficient, secure and resilient system. This challenge also includes addressing development challenges in low-carbon energy (supply), low-carbon societies (demand), and smart and flexible energy delivery and storage (Ayrton Fund, 2020).This is exactly the challenge that the PowerPath project aims to address in the context of sub-Saharan Africa. Through this work we aim to support both Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) and SDG13 (Climate Action).

Lateral Electrification is an innovative electrification model for rural Africa. It is based on the collaborative building of smart power grids from the bottom up by diffusing and progressively clustering basic smart units of power production, storage and distribution called “nanogrids”. These are installed and operated by local entrepreneurs to answer off-grid households’ basic energy needs more rapidly, flexibly and affordably than individual Solar Home Systems (SHS) while participating in the progressive building of decentralized, decarbonized and smart power infrastructures able to support growing energy needs. This is a model that aims to build a horizontal industry organisation powered by local entrepreneurship. 

Since the objective of the progressive technological concept is to cluster smaller power infrastructures to be able to deliver more intense energy services, new appliances (comply with power output) have to be sourced and new services have to be defined at every step of the process.",568892,,,"Award Setup",,Successful,"Pre-award Admin",2,2024-04-01,2026-03-31,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"INNOVATE UK Innovate UK","INNOVATE UK Default Scheme","UK Central Government","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"Energy Catalyst Round 10: Mid Stage",,https://apply-for-innovation-funding.service.gov.uk/competition/1460/overview/36602eaa-b37b-4ac3-90fe-4e2a33bb4768,,"2023-06-28 12:00",1500000.00,"2023-06-28 14:39",,"2024-06-27 00:00",2023-09-25,,"Shiladitya Paul (SP660)","Hong Dong (HD38)","Kranthi Maniam (KM508),Vikas Kumar (VK115)","Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,,,,"SE/EN: Mechanics of materials",,"SE/EN: Mechanics of materials","SE/EN: TWI Innovation Centre",,"SE/EN: TWI Innovation Centre",,,,,,"99 - Not Applicable for Institute reporting",,"Anna Kardas (AM565)",,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Towards a new power infrastructure development path for rural Africa (PowerPath)",,,,,,"2023-06-22 09:31",,,,,,"TECHNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS LTD.

"Inequality and the Role of Work Hours: Understanding the Determinants of Work Hours Choices",,"Income inequality and be viewed as the result of differences in both wages and work hours. Working part-time has important implications both for current and future earnings, as part-time work has been shown to limit career progression. As a result, it is important to better understand who works how much and why. In this project, we aim to contribute to this issue by studying two particular aspects relating to the work hours choice. The first is adjustment frictions in work hours; that is, to what extent individuals are able to quickly adjust their work hours when their circumstances change. Such frictions have important implications for the design of labour market policies, such as job search assistance. Second, we want to study the impact of early-career health shocks, which limit individuals' ability to continue in full-time work and thereby have implications for their future career. To study these topics, we want to draw on unique administrative data from the Netherlands which can be linked with survey evidence from the LISS panel, creating a rich dataset with both high-quality data on labour market histories and an extensive set of background variables for each individual.",553476,RS10W553476,,"Project Live",Locked,Successful,"Piotr Denderski (PRD10),Post-award Admin,Pre-award Admin,Tim Obermeier (TO111)",2,2023-10-01,2025-09-30,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"BRITISH ACADEMY The British Academy","BA/Leverhulme Small Research Grants","Research Councils (BEIS) - Roy Society and Brit Academy","T3 - 20% VAT on Expenditure - not recoverable,Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"British Academy/Leverhulme Small Research Grants",,https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/funding/ba-leverhulme-small-research-grants/,,"2023-05-31 17:00",10000.00,"2023-05-31 16:35",,"2024-05-30 00:00",2023-09-05,,"Tim Obermeier (TO111)","Piotr Denderski (PRD10)",,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,,,,"SS/BU: Acc'ing, Ec'mics & Finance, Dept",,"SS/BU: Acc'ing, Ec'mics & Finance, Dept","SS/BU: Acc'ing, Ec'mics & Finance, Dept",,"SS/BU: Acc'ing, Ec'mics & Finance, Dept",,No,,,,"99 - Not Applicable for Institute reporting",,"Helena Wright (HW194)","Daksha Patel (DP230)","Post-award Admin (Project Setup)","Post-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Economics & econometrics",SRG23\231796,"10 - Automatic payment by Funder - Actual Costs",,"Not Applicable for HEBCI","Not applicable for HEBCI",,"2023-05-24 21:55",,,,,,,9613.20,9614.00,64213.50,117693.91,9613.20,9614.00,-108079.92,8.17,0.00,0,-56860.72,-591.44,9614.00,9614.00,0.00,9614.00,0.00,9614.00,9614.00,9614.00,9614.00,9614.00,0.00,9614.00,0.00,9614.00,9614.00,0.00,0.00,62692.72,56860.72,5832.00,0.00,45387.20,0.00,9614.00,9613.20,117693.91,64213.50,9614.00,9613.20,-108079.92,8.17,0.00,0,-56860.72,-591.44,"2023-09-22 13:50:43",,Discoverable,,"2023-05-17 11:46:39","Tim Obermeier (TO111)","2023-09-22 13:50"

"The Only Good Antibodies Project: BETTER ANTIBODY CHARACTERISATION, BETTER SCIENCE, BETTER TREATMENTS","OGA Project","Antibodies are one of the most important tools used in medical research. They are Y-shaped molecules that scientists use for their ability to recognise, and stick to, specific targets. They are used to identify which proteins and how much of these proteins are present in a biological sample, and whether there is more or less of a given protein  . This can help scientists to work out which proteins might be important in disease. Data from antibody experiments informs drug design, and sometimes antibodies themselves are used as drugs.
Unfortunately, a large proportion of antibodies used for research purposes are unreliable, meaning they either do not recognise the target they are meant to, or they also recognise lots of other proteins. Two large studies  suggest that this is a problem for more than half of available antibodies. Unreliable antibodies lead to expensive waste of resources, including human tissue, and failures of expensive research projects and drug development .
The reasons for the use of unreliable antibodies are complex. Contributing factors include a lack of awareness amongst researchers and the high costs (money, time and effort) of running experiments to test the quality of available antibodies. Our proposal aims to lay the foundation for eliminating the problem of inappropriate antibody use and improve the quality and reliability of biomedical research as a result.
The main things we will do are:  
•	Explore  ways to come to an agreement with all the main parties about how to fund the necessary quality control work, and how to make sure best practises are quickly adopted by the international science community.
•	Form an international community of data curators to rapidly share high quality data, using existing tools that can automatically inform research funders and publishers.
•	Produce new frameworks that researchers must adhere to if they want their research projects funded/approved or published.
•	Develop the necessary skills in the UK to take up some of the best practise internationally on this issue.
•	Produce tools to support researchers in best practises, considering their experiences and concerns.",556923,,,"Bid Development",,Pending,"Adam Wright (AKAW3),Colin Veal (CDV1),Eva Krockow (EMK12),Harvinder Virk (HSV6),Michael Biddle (MSB65),Panayiota Stylianou (PS401),Pre-award Admin",3,2024-05-01,2027-04-30,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"MRC MRC","MRC Default Scheme","Research Councils - MRC","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"Better Methods, Better Research",,https://www.ukri.org/opportunity/better-methods-better-research/,,"2023-11-03 10:20",625000.00,,,,,,"Harvinder Virk (HSV6)","Eva Krockow (EMK12)","Colin Veal (CDV1),Michael Biddle (MSB65),Panayiota Stylianou (PS401),Adam Wright (AKAW3)","Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,,"Partner not Listed",,"LS: Respiratory Sciences","LS: Neuroscience, Psychology & Behaviour","LS: Neuroscience, Psychology & Behaviour,LS: Respiratory Sciences","LS: Respiratory Sciences","LS: Neuroscience, Psychology & Behaviour","LS: Neuroscience, Psychology & Behaviour,LS: Respiratory Sciences",,,,,,"99 - Not Applicable for Institute reporting",,,,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Planned Co-I: Irina Stefana (Oxford)

"Evaluating balanced pathways to Net Zero",EPaNZ,"The project will develop and metrics for environmental condition, performance and suitability for agriculture and wider land use, e.g. a range of crops, biodiversity, carbon sequestration, soil health, ecosystem regeneration, and their statistical distributions for pilot regions, including the East Anglian Fens, and provide projections of their dynamic change in space and time over the next 30 years as they respond to policy, land use change and climate. 
The distributions will be derived from a digital twin of the land system (combining JULES, ECOSSE and DSSAT and an ecosystem services model) driven by climate ensembles for climate change pathways. These ensemble projections provide the transient carbon emissions over the next decades and their likelihoods and can be linked with socio-economic and other data. They provide information on the likelihood of achieving targets. The spatio-temporal projections provide for the evaluation of connectivity in the landscape e.g. for biodiversity. 
Pathways to net zero, will be co-produced with stakeholders to consider the economic, social and emotional impacts, include local knowledge and identities and explore potential conflict between local priorities and national policies.
Where there are no suitable metrics, artificial intelligence approaches may be used to determine useful metrics – potentially on-demand in a user driven system. 
The project will be able to respond to new policy priorities as the digital twin can incorporate new policies. Emphasis in digital twin development will be on co-design with policy makers and other stakeholders, usability by government and relevance for and complimentary with government modelling.",577854,,,"Bid Submission",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",3,2024-03-01,2027-02-28,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"UKRI UK Research and Innovation UKRI","UKRI Default Scheme","Research Councils - UKRI","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"Land use for net zero – research (LUNZ-Research)",,https://www.ukri.org/opportunity/land-use-for-net-zero-research-lunz-research/,,"2023-07-11 16:00",,,,,,,"Jorg Kaduk (JK61)","Juan Berrio (JCB34),Ashiq Anjum (AA1180),Martin Phillips (MPP2)",,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,"University of Liverpool",,,,"SE/GE: Physical Geography","SE/CM: Computing Sciences,SE/GE: Human Geography","SE/CM: Computing Sciences,SE/GE: Human Geography,SE/GE: Physical Geography","SE/GE: Physical Geography","SE/CM: Computing Sciences,SE/GE: Human Geography","SE/CM: Computing Sciences,SE/GE: Human Geography,SE/GE: Physical Geography",,,,,,,,,,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2023-09-22 10:40",,,,,,"Expression of interest only",,0.00,,0.00,,0.00,0.00,0,0.00,0,0.00,0,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,,0.00,,0.00,,0.00,0,0.00,0,0.00,0,"2023-09-22 10:40:26",,Private,,"2023-07-04 15:10:49","Jorg Kaduk (JK61)","2023-09-22 10:40"

It is acknowledged that there is a great need for new processing technologies that achieve similar extraction rates but without the environmentally damaging waste products. Deep eutectic solvents (DES) are an innovative green technology with applications across primary and secondary materials processing. These solvents are composed of common, low cost,  low toxicity and environmentally well understood components and are able to achieve high metal solubilities and low temperatures and at ambient pressures. These characteristics make DES an ideal, potentially disruptive, technology for addressing the challenges associated with the extraction of gold from ores.

We will test whether ZYP2 and ZYP3 are required to implement crossover (CO) interference and CO assurance and how they form filamentous structures along the central element of the synaptonemal complex in conjunction with ZYP1 and the recently identified SC protein ASY5. ZYP2 and ZYP3 possess similar properties to mammalian SC proteins Tex12 and SYCE3, so our experiments will determine if they are orthologous and gain further insight into the organisation and function of the synaptonemal complex across animal and plant kingdoms.",567087,,,"Bid Awaiting Response",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",3,2024-09-01,2027-08-31,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"BBSRC BBSRC BIOTECH.& BIOLOG.SCIENCE","BBSRC Default Scheme","Research Councils - BBSRC","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,,,https://www.ukri.org/opportunity/bbsrc-standard-research-grant/,,"2023-09-27 17:00",2000000.00,"2023-09-19 17:00",,"2024-09-18 00:00",,,"James Higgins (JH555)",,,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,"UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH",,,,"LS: Genetics & Genome Biology",,"LS: Genetics & Genome Biology","LS: Genetics & Genome Biology",,"LS: Genetics & Genome Biology",,No,,,,"99 - Not Applicable for Institute reporting",,"Yelena Mazulina (YM41)",,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2023-09-19 14:03",,,,,,,478285.35,478285.35,637917.71,637917.71,621670.69,621670.69,-159632.36,74.98,135943.80,28.42,107536.84,22.48,329006.32,621670.69,0.00,621670.69,0.00,621670.69,342341.56,342341.56,329006.32,621670.69,0.00,621670.69,0.00,621670.69,156504.00,78000.00,63504.00,108353.96,28406.96,57687.30,6959.70,187222.20,0.00,478285.35,478285.35,637917.71,637917.71,621670.69,621670.69,-159632.36,74.98,135943.80,28.42,107536.84,22.48,"2023-09-19 17:00:19",,Discoverable,,"2023-06-13 14:08:14","James Higgins (JH555)","2023-09-19 17:02"

"K-AHEAD: Knowledge-Aware High-fidelity and comprEhensive Advanced air mobility Development",K-AHEAD,"This initiative aims to develop unprecedented analysis and design methods and tools enabling the development of Advanced Air Mobility(AAM) vehicles.
AAM development brings transformative air ambulance and personal aerial vehicles into reality and into our daily lives. This transforms the current ground-infrastructure-based 2D transport to seamless 3D aerial connectivity. Such connectivity represents a critical and necessary technological advantage to improve emergency responses, address uprising global challenges, drive economic growth, and forever change our travel and lifestyles. With electrical propulsion, it substantially decarbonises while decongesting urban spaces, promising a seamlessly connected and sustainable future. As enabling technologies e.g. electrification and manufacturing steadily mature, AAM development has gained compelling global momentum[12,27] recently. 
However, AAM vehicle design, e.g. aerodynamic shapes and configurations, remains a major barrier. Current AAM prototypes often adopt radically unconventional designs, due to extraordinary scopes e.g. electrical propulsion and stringent safety/emission constraints. With existing design/analysis approaches developed for conventional aircraft, these prototype designs rarely succeed. This exposes 3 major challenges(Fig1.): 1.the lack of accurate multi-physics analysis ability, 2.the excessive problem dimensionality coupling multi-physics, design, and operation, and 3.the scarcity of reliable data and new knowledge.
This initiative delivers transformative design and analysis solutions to tackle these challenges. Instead of current sequential and simplified multi-physics analyses, this work formulates multiple physics as one comprehensive problem and solves it with first-principle-based modelling(Fig2), enabling more accurate and comprehensive analysis. 
Further, instead of relying on engineering experience/intuition, we will construct intelligent agents to manage the problem dimensionality(Fig3). These agents will establish quantitative knowledge correlations, and drive knowledge-aware adaptive analysis, delivering accurate results at reduced costs and providing intelligent models for digital twinning. 
Finally, with these pioneering methods/tools, this initiative will develop the world’s first benchmark AAM design cases for common R&D. All results will be publicly disseminated for widespread impact and excellence.",598387,,,"Bid Awaiting Response",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",5,2024-08-01,2029-07-31,,"RF - Research Fellowship",Research,,"ROYAL ACAD ENGINRG ROYAL ACADEMY OF ENGINEERING","ROYAL ACAD ENGINRG Default Scheme","UK Charities (Open Competition & External Peer Review)","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"Research Fellowship 2023/2024",,https://raeng.org.uk/media/w1jiirzr/raeng-applicant-guidance-research-fellowship-2023-2024.pdf,,"2023-09-17 14:35",625000.00,"2023-09-19 11:57",,"2024-09-18 00:00",,,"Tao Zhang (TZ77)",,,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,,,,"SE/EN: Aero' & Computational Engineering",,"SE/EN: Aero' & Computational Engineering","SE/EN: Aero' & Computational Engineering",,"SE/EN: Aero' & Computational Engineering",,,,,,"99 - Not Applicable for Institute reporting",,"Sara Mounteney (SLM81)",,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2023-09-13 13:23",,,,,,,615970.68,615970.68,811924.34,811924.34,769963.34,769963.34,-195953.66,75.87,185666.34,30.14,185666.34,30.14,388343.34,769963.34,0.00,769963.34,0.00,769963.34,430304.34,430304.34,388343.34,769963.34,0.00,769963.34,0.00,769963.34,21500.00,6500.00,0.00,97950.00,0.00,87405.00,10545.00,283670.00,0.00,615970.68,615970.68,811924.34,811924.34,769963.34,769963.34,-195953.66,75.87,185666.34,30.14,185666.34,30.14,"2023-09-19 11:57:28",,Discoverable,,"2023-08-13 14:33:46","Tao Zhang (TZ77)","2023-09-19 11:57"

"Talent for Hybrid Energy Storage systems",T4HESS,"T4HESS programme will offer positions for doctoral researchers of any nationality in 8 international calls in order to develop individual and freely selected research projects at the recruiting organizations during a 36-48 months period. The programme will recruit the researchers through an open, informed, efficient and transparent, supportive, and internationally comparable selection process that will follow the administrative requirements of each country public administration and will be based on the principles established in the European Charter for Researchers and the European Code of Conduct for the Recruitment of Researchers. The researchers’ selection will ensure equal treatment for all candidates, facilitating in particular access of disadvantaged fellows, as researchers at risk or with disabilities.

T4HESS will be focused on generating in-depth knowledge and promoting excellent talent within a number of specific scientific and technological specialization areas in the field of Energy, in line with expertise and longterm priorities of the Implementing Partners that will recruit and host the researchers. The programme will involve
both academic and industrial participating organizations with strong expertise on energy technologies, guaranteeing this way an attractive, cross-sectoral and international ecosystem with a focus on energy storage, namely, on Hybrid Energy Storage Systems. This is a recent branch of energy storage that replies to current limitations of single energy storage system (ESS). A single ESS does not fulfil all the requirements for certain operations and has different trade-offs for overall system performance. This is mainly due to the limited capability of a single ESS and the potency concerning cost, lifespan, power and energy density, and dynamic response. To overcome the trade-off issue resulting from using a single ESS system, a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) consisting of two or more ESS appears as an effective solution.

The programme design relies on the objectives posed by the EC to demonstrate different battery technologies, including next-generation storage technologies. Furthermore, T4HESS is a demand-driven research programme addressing the significant challenges Europe faces in the fields of Renewable Energy.",617334,,,"Bid Development",,Pending,"Kranthi Maniam (KM508),Pre-award Admin,Shiladitya Paul (SP660)",4,2024-08-01,2028-07-31,,"RO - Standard Research",Other,,"CEC CEC","CEC Default Scheme","EU Government Bodies (inc European Commission but not UK)","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"MSCA Doctoral Networks 2023 (HORIZON-MSCA-2023-DN-01-01)",,https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/horizon-msca-2023-dn-01-01,,"2023-11-28 16:00",,,,,,,"Shiladitya Paul (SP660)","Kranthi Maniam (KM508)",,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,,,,"SE/EN: TWI Innovation Centre",,"SE/EN: TWI Innovation Centre","SE/EN: TWI Innovation Centre",,"SE/EN: TWI Innovation Centre",,,,,,,,,,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Hi Anna, I am looking at MSCA Doctoral Training Networks.

The University was coordinator of a project with the same funding in 2014-2018. The project was called ""INTREPID Forensics"", Grant agreement ID: 607930; Professor Lisa Smith was the PI. More recently, the University was involved in ""YEASTDOC""Grant agreement ID: 764927 (from 2017-2022)

We won't be the coordinator of this project so a bit less of management time. The funding is tied to the number of  PhDs we train so this would be a bit different. I have attached the document that gives more information on the funding. As the University was previously involved in such projects, I think your team would have knowledge of the funding.

"Developing an SDE for projects of the future",,"The EM SDE needs to demonstrate how it can support meaningful high impact projects. There are several projects which are being led by Leicester which would enable this type of approach to be used and can enable regional collaboration. Through this they will help develop an SDE which is fit-for-purpose for several different research-scenarios, at a local and a national level.

Proposal:
Financial and operational support for two high impact projects is proposed:

Project 1
Leicester lead the NIHR Diabetes Health Informatics Collaborative - a repository of diabetes data from across the UK managed, collected and standardised both locally and centrally. This project requires an NHS-based SDE which is currently unavailable in Leicester. The resources to support this type of infrastructure are currently limited.

Project 2
Differential experience and outcomes for patients from more deprived communities and ethnic minorities has been a problem for many years, but came to the fore during the COVID pandemic. We propose to build a minimal data set (based on work at Leicester) from across the region that includes data by ethnicity and deprivation to allow in depth service evaluation and research to understand and address health inequalities. Through disaggregation of the data by ethnicity and deprivation and through better understanding of the situation we will be able to take proactive approaches to redressing health inequalities.",616872,,,"Bid Development",,Pending,"Nigel Brunskill (NJB18),Pre-award Admin,Robert Free (RCF8)",2,2023-11-01,2025-05-31,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"LLR ICB NHS Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland Integrated Care Board","LLR ICB Default Scheme","UK Health & Hospitals","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Robert Free (RCF8)","Nigel Brunskill (NJB18)",,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,,,,"SE/CM: Computing Sciences","LS: Cardiovascular Sciences","LS: Cardiovascular Sciences,SE/CM: Computing Sciences","SE/CM: Computing Sciences","LS: Cardiovascular Sciences","LS: Cardiovascular Sciences,SE/CM: Computing Sciences",,,,,,,,,,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,681380.98,,1135726.61,,681380.98,-454345.63,60,-2218.57,-0.33,-32680.84,-4.8,681380.98,681380.98,0.00,681380.98,0.00,681380.98,683599.55,683599.55,681380.98,681380.98,0.00,681380.98,0.00,681380.98,89000.00,0.00,0.00,79337.40,30462.28,48708.16,166.96,372789.66,0.00,681380.98,,1135726.61,,681380.98,,-454345.63,60,-2218.57,-0.33,-32680.84,-4.8,"2023-09-14 16:35:34",,Private,,"2023-09-14 16:32:14","Robert Free (RCF8)","2023-09-19 10:44"

"Insects Inspired Small Targets Motion Detection (inSTMD)",inSTMD,"Ability to perceive small moving objects in distance is critical for autonomous robots and vehicles to spot hazards. On the other aspect, small moving objects, or targets like drones, which pose potential threat to public safety, should be detected automatically for further inspection. Detecting moving objects in distance with limited resources on board a robot or a vehicle is challenging, however it is significant to safety. In this project, we propose to take inspiration from insects’ small target motion detection (STMD) neural circuits for small moving targets detection and to build compact sensor systems for robots or vehicles to detect small moving objects automatically. We will build new STMD models inspired by insects’ visual pathway, to explore methods to hardware realization of the model with the most advanced visual sensors such as event camera and high-performance chips for modulization and miniaturization. We will build demonstrator systems to test, verify and demonstrate the performance of the insects’ inspired STMD system.",616499,,,"Bid Development",,Pending,"Pre-award Admin,Shigang Yue (SY237)",5,2024-05-01,2029-04-30,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"EPSRC EPSRC ENG.& PHYS.SCIENCES R C","EPSRC Default Scheme","Research Councils - EPSRC","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Shigang Yue (SY237)",,,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,,,,"SE/CM: Computing Sciences",,"SE/CM: Computing Sciences","SE/CM: Computing Sciences",,"SE/CM: Computing Sciences",,,,,,,,,,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"plan to request 2 postdocs each for 4.5 years, PI 10%FTE for 5years, co-PIs 5% for 5years, equipments (cameras £15k, platform with robots £89k, publication open access for 2 papers in NML £16k and 2 papers in TNNLS £4k, int.conference 3 times at start/mid/end of project for each postdoc PI 2coPI each trip £2k total 3x2x4=£24k, other books components and consumables £5k.",,0.00,,0.00,,0.00,0.00,0,0.00,0,0.00,0,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,,0.00,,0.00,,0.00,0,0.00,0,0.00,0,"2023-09-14 12:59:40",,Private,,"2023-09-14 12:31:24","Shigang Yue (SY237)","2023-09-14 12:59"

"NbS for Improved Climate Resilience (NICE): Water storage for equitable drought and flood resilience in Nigeria and Malawi",NICE,"Nature-based solutions (NbS) that provide distributed water storage have the potential to (i) decrease and attenuate local and downstream flood waves during intense rainfall, (ii) provide additional water storage for local household use and livelihoods, (iii) provide mechanisms for groundwater recharge potentially increasing catchment-scale drought resilience and (iv) provide additional ecosystem and cultural benefits. However, the success and value of these NbS depend on skilful placement of these features to optimise benefit for all users and effective management of potential risks and trade-offs associated with the NbS (e.g. disease, drowning, displacement). Therefore, a transdisciplinary approach is required to first understand the value of multiple NbS benefits to all users across appropriate spatial scales, to then inform implementation of water storage NbS that are equitable, provide net-benefit, and are sustainable in the long-term. Two case study locations, one in Nigeria and one in Malawi will be used to examine NbS for safe water storage across rural and urban locations and to investigate the contextualisation of feasibility, benefits and value of similar NbS.",594789,,,"Bid Awaiting Response",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",3,2024-02-01,2027-01-31,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"UKRI UK Research and Innovation UKRI","UKRI Default Scheme","Research Councils - UKRI","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"Equitable nature-based climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa",,https://www.ukri.org/opportunity/equitable-nature-based-climate-resilience-in-sub-saharan-africa/,,"2023-09-13 16:00",2250000.00,"2023-09-13 10:05",,"2024-09-12 00:00",,,"Lee Bosher (LSB23)","Moya Burns (MLB40)",,"Only people involved in this project",,"Loughborough University",Yes,"Partner not Listed",,"Partner not Listed",,"SS/BU: M'ing, Innov', Str'gy & Ops, Dept","Genetics & Genome Biology","Genetics & Genome Biology,SS/BU: M'ing, Innov', Str'gy & Ops, Dept","SS/BU: M'ing, Innov', Str'gy & Ops, Dept","LS: Genetics & Genome Biology","LS: Genetics & Genome Biology,SS/BU: M'ing, Innov', Str'gy & Ops, Dept",,,,,,"99 - Not Applicable for Institute reporting","MALAWI,NIGERIA",,,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Business & management studies",,,,,,,"2023-09-01 10:47",,,,,,"This proposal is being led by Dr Tim Marjoribanks at Loughborough University.

"Are early life environments effects on ageing mediated by the epigenetic clock?",,"This project will help understand the proximate causes of life history evolution by establishing the effect of larval diapause on insect epigenetic ageing. This extends our discovery of epigenetics’s role in several insect life history traits (1). Why individuals and species age so differently is one of the biggest unanswered questions in evolutionary biology (2).
Environments can be variable and organisms can be selected to sense the state of their environ- ment early in life and to adaptively adjust their life history in response to these changes (3). The ability of one genotype to produce different life-histories depending on the environment is known as a life-history polyphenism (3). We ask could epigenetics and specifially the epigenetic clock be a proximate mechanism of these life-history polyphenisms.
An epigenetic clock is a biochemical test based on measuring the accumulation of chemical marks (DNA methylation) to DNA molecules (4). There is evidence epigenetic age mirrors true biological age and its associated morbidity and mortality better than chronological age (5). The rate at which an epigenetic clock ticks is strongly affected by the environment. This seems especially true in the early stages of life (6). This gives rise to the idea that an epigenetic clock can be developmentally tuned as part of an adaptive response to environmental variables experienced during development (6).
Aging is a complex process influenced by many environmental and genetic components. The effects of these components influence each other making them difficult to investigate, especially in complex mammalian models. Therefore, a large body of ageing research is based on simple model invertebrate organisms (7, 8). Advantages include easy and cheap to keep in a laboratory, short lifespan, genetic and molecular tools available, and a sequenced genome. However, the current invertebrate models of ageing (Drosophila (9) and C. elegans (10)) do not possess detectable DNA methylation, reducing their generality.
The jewel wasp, Nasonia vitripennis, an emerging model system (11) has a functional methylation system (12) making it an ideal system to investigate the epigenetics of ageing. We therefore mea- sured chronological ageing and changes in the epigenome using whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) in order to discover if Nasonia vitripennis possessed an epigenetic clock. The epigenetic age of each replicate is the weighted average of each genes’ methylation state. This epigenetic age does indeed correlate with chronological age (13). This is similar to results found in many vertebrates (6). However, this is the first time an epigenetic clock has been discovered in a tractable insect model.
An example of a life-history polyphenism in Nasonia is larval diapause, an overwintering stage where development is arrested and adult lifespan is increased (14). DNA methylation is involved in Nasonia diapause (15). Using published RNA-seq datasets (16), we have found an increase in the expression of DMNT1a (the enzyme responsible for DNA methylation maintenance) and a decrease in TET (the enzyme that removes methylation) in diapaused versus non-diapaused larvae. This suggests a maintenance of DNA methylation during diapause.",603066,,,"Bid Awaiting Response",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",3,2025-01-01,2027-12-31,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"BBSRC BBSRC BIOTECH.& BIOLOG.SCIENCE","BBSRC Default Scheme","Research Councils - BBSRC","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"BBSRC standard research grant September 2023 (23RM3)",,https://www.ukri.org/opportunity/bbsrc-standard-research-grant/,,"2023-09-27 16:00",2000000.00,"2023-09-13 11:04",,"2024-09-12 00:00",,,"Eamonn Mallon (EBM3)","Charalambos Kyriacou (CPK)",,"Only people involved in this project",,,,,,,,"LS: Genetics & Genome Biology",,"LS: Genetics & Genome Biology","LS: Genetics & Genome Biology",,"LS: Genetics & Genome Biology",,No,,,,"99 - Not Applicable for Institute reporting",,,,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2023-08-30 13:16",,,,,,,595792.38,595792.38,770439.23,770439.23,744740.47,744740.47,-174646.85,77.33,151075.11,25.36,88670.95,14.88,419018.50,744740.47,0.00,744740.47,0.00,744740.47,444717.26,444717.26,419018.50,744740.47,0.00,744740.47,0.00,744740.47,135235.20,46560.00,0.00,129989.67,62404.17,60309.45,7276.05,195732.30,0.00,595792.38,595792.38,770439.23,770439.23,744740.47,744740.47,-174646.85,77.33,151075.11,25.36,88670.95,14.88,"2023-09-13 11:04:51",,Discoverable,,"2023-08-23 11:41:27","Eamonn Mallon (EBM3)","2023-09-13 11:04"
"Towards Co-produced Resilient Futures: Equitable Nature-Based Solutions in Forest and Pastoral Systems",,"Our research focuses on (linked) pastoral and forest landscapes and livelihoods in Kenya and Senegal. Through in-depth transdisciplinary research with local community actors, academics, NGOs and policymakers in these important socio-ecological systems we address all key themes of the call: contexualisation and scalability of NbS and the role of community governance and knowledges therein. We do so through i) comparative analysis of current & future climate impacts on ecosystems, livelihoods and communities in our study areas and as part of a suite of wider global challenges, ii) evaluation of the role of specific NbS therein, under current and future climate scenarios; iii) examination of the scalability and place-specificity of these solutions; iv) our focus throughout on diverse, indigenous, local and gendered, knowledges, knowledge recognition & mobilisation.
We identify pastoral and forested landscapes as critical to rural livelihoods and ecologies, and as exemplifying some of the challenges and potentials of NbS in SSA, particularly for climate resilience and adaptation. In Kenya, unprecedented recent drought events have highlighted both the importance and limitations of diverse pastoralist NbS, often linked to community-based rangeland governance and recognition of knowledges and rights. Similarly in forested ecosystems, remote sensing (RS)-based technologies are enabling key actors such as Kenya Forest Service (KFS) to forge new partnerships with Community Forestry Associations (CFAs) to develop and recognise NbS for deforestation-free livelihoods, with downstream impacts on critical ecosystem services (ES) and pastoral systems.  In Senegal these key ecosystems and communities are facing comparable challenges, with the recent emergence of a range of adaptive, NbS.
These innovations merit, urgent critical attention – a challenge to which our project responds. For example, for both countries, diverse future climate scenarios, in conjunction with land surface and ES models, can be used to project the potential evolutions of particular NbS and facilitate enhanced community adaptive capacity and risk management.
Specifically we ask:
1.	What NbS solutions exist in our case study sites and what is their efficacy and limitations in relation to livelihoods, ecologies and climate adaptation?
2.	How are these NbS evolving and with what implications under diverse future climate scenarios?
3.	What elements of these NbS and local knowledges are scalable to other contexts and geographies?

"Artificial intelligence in predicting Diabetes reMission following barIatric surgeRy in patients with type 2 diabetEs using multi-ethnic population databases in the United Kingdom (ADMIRE)",ADMIRE,"Background:
Bariatric surgery, a very clinically and cost-effective treatment for obesity, has shown promising outcomes in inducing diabetes remission or significant improvement in glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, factors influencing diabetes remission after bariatric surgery are multiple and interconnected, presenting a challenge for healthcare professionals to accurately use them to predict individual-patient outcomes. Albeit several predictive scoring systems – such as DiaRem, Ad-DiaRem, DiaBetter, individualized metabolic surgery (IMS) score, and the ABCD score – have been proposed, notable heterogeneity still exists in outcomes after the surgery. Additionally, they have either been developed using small sample size, or have been shown to have limited predictability for long term remission. Successfully identifying factors that contribute to both short- and long-term diabetes remission would optimize the patient selection process and improve the likelihood of successful outcomes after bariatric surgery.
 
Objective:
This study will explore the use of machine learning methods in predicting diabetes remission using large-scale electronic health records in the United Kingdom (UK).

Study Location:
The project will be based on the Real World Evidence Unit (LRWEU), Leicester Diabetes Centre (LDC) at the University of Leicester. The LDC is a renowned institution dedicated to diabetes research, education, and patient care. The LRWEU is recognized for its expertise in analysing real-world data from clinical settings and patient records. This data-driven approach will provide valuable insights into diabetes management, treatment outcomes, and patient experiences in real-life scenarios.

Data Source:
We will analyse routinely collected and de-identified electronic healthcare records from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), for which we have an active user licence. This is a large UK-based database that contains patient information such as demographics, lifestyle factors, clinical diagnoses, medication history, and laboratory test results. CPRD will be linked to Hospital Episode Statistics admitted patient care, Office for National Statistics death registry and Index of Multiple Deprivation.
 
Study population and methods:
The study cohort will include adults (age ≥18 years) with type 2 diabetes who underwent bariatric surgery. Bariatric surgery will be identified from both primary care and hospitalisations records and will be categorised into four types:  Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, gastric band, sleeve gastrectomy, and other. Diabetes remission will be defined as the HbA1c level consistently remaining below 6.5% for at least three months within the follow-up period after the surgery, without being prescribed any glucose-lowering medication or insulin (reference: https://www.diabetes.org.uk/about_us/news/remission-new-definition).
The next step in the study will be selecting relevant predictors that may influence diabetes remission, such as age, gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, BMI, HbA1c, diabetes duration, medication usage (including oral glucose-lowering drugs, insulin, GLP1-RA, antidepressants, antihypertensives), comorbidities, blood pressure, lipids, and lifestyle factors (e.g., alcohol intake, smoking status). Data pre-processing techniques will be applied to handle missing values, normalise numerical features, and encode categorical variables.
Three supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms, such as logistic regression, random forests, and gradient boosting will be employed to build predictive models for diabetes remission after bariatric surgery. These algorithms are chosen due to their ability to handle both linear and non-linear relationships within the data, and their potential to reveal complex patterns that might influence diabetes remission. The dataset will be split by time period at the patient level into training and testing sets, and the ML models will be trained on the training data. Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation techniques, such as k-fold cross-validation, will be employed to optimise the model's performance and ensure the robustness of the models and to minimise overfitting. Model performance on the test set will be evaluated using various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC). Additionally, feature importance analysis will be conducted to identify the most influential factors contributing to diabetes remission. We will also evaluate the predictive capability of these new models with existing scores listed above.

Practical Implications:
The predictive models that will be developed in this study will have practical implications in clinical settings. They can aid healthcare professionals in identifying patients with type 2 diabetes who have a higher likelihood of achieving remission, enabling targeted interventions and personalised treatment plans. Our findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications, presentations at both national and international conferences, and reports directed towards healthcare professionals and patients.",603893,,,"Bid Awaiting Response",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",2,2024-08-01,2025-12-31,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"NIHR National Institute of Health Research","NIHR Default Scheme","UK Central Government","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"RfPB Under-represented disciplines and specialisms highlight notice: Methodologists",,https://www.nihr.ac.uk/funding/rfpb-under-represented-disciplines-and-specialisms-highlight-notice-methodologists/33231,,"2023-09-13 10:50",500000.00,"2023-09-13 10:56",,"2024-09-12 00:00",,,"Sharmin Shabnam (SS1279)","Kamlesh Khunti (KK22),Thomas Yates (TY20),Clare Gillies (CLG13),Dimitrios Papamargaritis (DP421),Francesco Zaccardi (FZ43)",,"Only people involved in this project",,"University of Southampton",Yes,,,,,"LS/HS: Diabetes",,"LS/HS: Diabetes","LS/HS: Diabetes",,"LS/HS: Diabetes",,,,,,,,"Thomas Barson (TB199)",,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2023-09-11 10:10",,,,,,,159415.76,159415.76,202542.25,202542.25,199269.71,199269.71,-43126.48,78.71,85807.49,53.83,60072.40,37.68,70474.39,199269.71,0.00,199269.71,0.00,199269.71,73608.27,73608.27,70474.39,199269.71,0.00,199269.71,0.00,199269.71,3500.00,0.00,0.00,62626.11,25735.10,8520.19,0.00,66307.86,0.00,136719.10,136719.10,174171.42,174171.42,170898.88,170898.88,-37452.32,78.5,63110.83,46.16,37375.73,27.34,"2023-09-13 10:56:24",,Discoverable,,"2023-08-24 10:51:11","Sharmin Shabnam (SS1279)","2023-09-13 10:56"

"Novel Mathematical Methods for Modelling in Ecology and Evolution",,"We propose a conference at UoL  on mathematical modelling in environmental sciences with the title 'Mathematical Models in Population Dynamics, Ecology and Evolution'.

The conference dates: April 15-18, 2024


The main aim of the conference is to bring together leading researchers in mathematical biology who explore processes and mechanisms in various biological systems ranging from a cell to the human society. A special focus will be on incorporating the complexity of biological systems in mathematical and computational models by linking processes on micro- and macroscales (in space and time). The meeting is also expected to explore similarities between modelling techniques traditionally applied in ecology and evolution and those used in other research areas (applied mathematics, physics, engineering) with the purpose to enhance interdisciplinary approaches and to stimulate further advances. The meeting will be an open forum for interaction between theoreticians, data scientists and empirical biologists with the main goal of enhancing communication between them.

The expected number of participants is 60-70 including  about 20 PhD students. The conference will consist of plenary talks, contributed talks, and a poster session. We expect that the large number of participants will be postgraduate research students.

"Repurposing the past: community heritage and archaeology in Jaffna, Sri Lanka",Jaffna,"Exploring the archaeology of the last 500 years, and focusing on material remains from ordinary people and everyday activities is a powerful means of directing the concepts of archaeology and heritage away from the elite and monumental remains and sites that dominate Sri Lanka’s cultural heritage narratives, and allowing new, community-driven ways of thinking about archaeology and heritage that resonate with the Tamil minority in the Jaffna Peninsula.  Emerging from five years of discussions, workshops, field visits between the Jaffna, Colombo and UK team members, the project has been co-designed in order to use archaeologies of the everyday and of the recent past to investigate identity, belonging and place, and to find ways to re-evaluate how archaeological and cultural heritages are understood.  
The current archaeological and cultural heritage of Sri Lanka was developed during British rule and privileged elite, monumental sites that showcased Sinhalese and Buddhist histories.  These systems have persisted since Independence and as a result, members of minority communities in Sri Lanka feel alienated from a version of heritage which does not represent them.  This is the case in Jaffna, where the Tamil community feels at best indifference towards archaeology and state-supported heritage, and at worst active distrust of the people and systems who work within these areas.  The ways in which the archaeological heritage of Sri Lanka were used to support claims of ethnic primacy and rights to land were a contributing factor in the long-running civil war (1983-2009).
This project will use historical archaeology of the recent and contemporary past (c.1500 CE to present) to explore the everyday and ordinary material remains of life in coastal Jaffna, and then find ways to translate this material record into relevant heritage that not only engages local communities, but is driven by them and has value for them.  An explicit project aim is to work with communities to find innovative ways of producing heritage (e.g. pop-up museums, festivals, exhibitions) alongside more conventional academic outputs.  
This project will be of benefit to communities in Jaffna (and potentially other parts of Sri Lanka) who do not recognise themselves in the state-approved archaeological and heritage narratives.  This is particularly challenging for the communities that were displaced during and after the civil war; recognition of the rich everyday practices and heritages which are so evident in the north will help people to re-think what their heritages may be in this region, and how to present them in ways they find meaningful.  This close interaction between the project team and communities will result in a transfer of curatorial, community and archaeological skills so that communities can continue to create their own narratives. This in turn will give communities the agency to create their own counter-narratives that might resist and challenge the current dominant hegemonic views of archaeology and cultural heritage identities in Sri Lanka.  By using archaeology and heritage to address issues of identity, belonging and place, this project has the potential to contribute to dialogue within and between communities in Jaffna.",592480,,,"Bid Awaiting Response",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",4,2024-07-01,2028-06-30,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"AHRC Arts & Humanities Research Council","AHRC Default Scheme","Research Councils - AHRC","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,,,https://www.ukri.org/opportunity/ahrc-responsive-mode-standard-research-grant/,,,1500000.00,"2023-09-12 15:37",,"2024-09-11 00:00",,,"Ruth Young (RLY3)","Sarina Wakefield (SJW148)",,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,"Partner not Listed","University of Exeter",,"SS/AH: Archaeology & Ancient History","Museum Studies","Museum Studies,SS/AH: Archaeology & Ancient History","SS/AH: Archaeology & Ancient History","SS/MS: Museum Studies","SS/AH: Archaeology & Ancient History,SS/MS: Museum Studies",,,,,,,,"William Hudson (WOH3)",,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2023-09-12 09:25",,,,,,,1228235.75,1228235.75,1496673.57,1496673.57,1486044.69,1486044.69,-268437.81,82.06,636732.45,51.84,541414.73,44.08,780875.67,1486044.69,0.00,1486044.69,0.00,1486044.69,591503.30,335628.30,328000.67,1486044.69,0.00,1486044.69,0.00,1486044.69,198945.00,400.00,0.00,284350.52,95317.72,23230.80,0.00,423819.75,197000.00,499472.23,499472.23,634969.17,634969.17,624340.29,624340.29,-135496.93,78.66,163843.93,32.8,68526.21,13.72,"2023-09-12 15:37:48",,Private,,"2023-08-01 14:32:56","Ruth Young (RLY3)","2023-09-12 15:37"

"Developing a neurological qualitative toolkit",,"Neurological qualitative toolkit
The use of qualitative methods within neurological health research has increased the quality and scope of the published literature, leading to greater understanding of diagnoses, explored life with an incurable condition, informed the creation of complex health interventions and provided the context for (un)successful delivery of such interventions. MRC guidelines recommend interviews and focus groups be used throughout the development of complex interventions.
However, the use of qualitative methods for people with neurological conditions (pwNC) can be challenging. Common neurological symptoms include behavioural changes, speech difficulties, loss of mobility and fatigue, which hinder the time intensive nature of qualitative data collection and require adaptations, which are not always adequately planned for. It can be confusing for researchers to choose between data collection methods, such as interviews, focus groups, ethnography, and qualitative surveys. There is also no guidance on the support researchers require when conducting qualitative research, which often involves practical as well as emotional challenges. 
This project aims to create a research toolkit for researchers who are conducting qualitative research with pwNC. The toolkit will contain a range of resources for researchers, providing guidance for how to conduct high quality, inclusive, qualitative research, taking into account the aspects outlined above. Three interconnected workstreams will complement one another to collect information and develop the guidance. 
First, a scoping review will explore what qualitative methods have been used previously with pwNC, highlight any positives and negatives to these approaches reported by researchers, and identify any adaptations that were made to data collection procedures. 
Second, semi-structured interviews involving pwNC, their families, and both novice and expert qualitative researchers will collect in-depth information on the experiences of engaging in qualitative research. Early findings from the scoping review will also be integrated into interviews. 
Third, pwNC, their families, and qualitative researchers will be invited to three co-production workshops to co-develop and refine the final guidance. This will adopt an iterative process, considering the data gathered during the other two workstreams. 
The toolkit will  be widely disseminated, to ensure that the recommendations are accessible to researchers, pwNC and other groups who would find them useful. This methodological toolkit could be beneficial in multiple areas. For example, due to the intensive data collection process, pwNC may not feel able to participate in qualitative research. By providing guidance on how to adapt common data collection processes, the recommendations we produce will increase the equality, diversity, and inclusivity of future research. Overall, the toolkit can increase the quality of neurological qualitative research, which will produce more impactful publications resulting in a higher profile for qualitative research and the increased use of this important methodology.",601541,,,"Bid Submission",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",2,2024-12-01,2026-05-31,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"NIHR National Institute of Health Research","NIHR Default Scheme","UK Central Government","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"RfPB methodologist call",,https://www.nihr.ac.uk/funding/rfpb-under-represented-disciplines-and-specialisms-highlight-notice-methodologists/33231,,"2023-09-13 00:00",,,,,,,"Sion Scott (SIS13)",,,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,,,,"LS/HC: Healthcare Research",,"LS/HC: Healthcare Research","LS/HC: Healthcare Research",,"LS/HC: Healthcare Research",,No,,,,,,"Yusuf Dedat (YD134)",,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2023-09-12 15:02",,,,,,,,8562.79,,11035.78,,10703.49,-2472.98,77.59,8562.79,100,2328.82,27.2,0.00,10703.49,0.00,10703.49,0.00,10703.49,0.00,0.00,0.00,10703.49,0.00,10703.49,0.00,10703.49,0.00,0.00,0.00,6780.73,6233.98,546.75,0.00,4255.05,0.00,8562.79,,11035.78,,10703.49,,-2472.98,77.59,8562.79,100,2328.82,27.2,"2023-09-12 15:02:39",,Discoverable,,"2023-08-21 08:11:50","Sion Scott (SIS13)","2023-09-12 15:02"

"Perceived Causal Relations of Determinants of Health: Adapting Network Analytic Approaches",,"Determining views of causality is important because causal intuitions inform views about appropriate interventions. Studying causal intuitions can help understand why structural or social determinants of complex constructs such as health, are often overlooked in favour of biological or lifestyle causes. Whilst qualitative approaches to lay intuitions are rarely scalable or generalisable, existing quantitative methods drastically over-simplify people’s representations of causality. An alternative solution is offered by network analysis, a set of statistical techniques that enable analysis and visualisation of relational data, and which accords better with the notion that lay representations are viewed as networks of events. This programme will apply recent advances in network analysis to develop a new method for assessing perceived causal relations, focusing on the social determinants of health. It will develop UK academic expertise in this burgeoning area and enable a much richer understanding of perceived causal relations of health than heretofore.",591023,,,"Bid Awaiting Response",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",1,2024-03-01,2025-02-28,,"OO - Other Services (OSR)",Other,,"BRITISH ACADEMY The British Academy","BRITISH ACADEMY Default Scheme","Research Councils (BEIS) - Roy Society and Brit Academy","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"Talent Development Grant",,https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/funding/talent-development-awards/,,"2023-09-13 17:00",10000.00,"2023-09-11 13:16",,"2024-09-10 00:00",,,"Emma Bridger (EB441)","John Maltby (JM148)",,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,,,,"LS: Psychology",,"LS: Psychology","LS: Psychology",,"LS: Psychology",,,,,,,,"William Hudson (WOH3)",,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2023-08-15 15:31",,,,,,,8740.59,8740.59,8740.59,8740.59,8740.59,8740.59,0.00,100,7748.59,88.65,7748.59,88.65,992.00,8740.59,0.00,8740.59,0.00,8740.59,992.00,992.00,992.00,8740.59,0.00,8740.59,0.00,8740.59,992.00,0.00,0.00,7748.59,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,8740.59,8740.59,8740.59,8740.59,8740.59,8740.59,0.00,100,7748.59,88.65,7748.59,88.65,"2023-09-11 13:16:29",,Private,,"2023-07-28 10:35:29","Emma Bridger (EB441)","2023-09-11 13:16"
"Guidance for primary teachers on teaching mathematics to children in care",,"Governments in the UK and elsewhere have raised concern about the low average levels of educational attainment reached by children in public care, with subsequent limiting effects on each child’s life chances. Care-experienced children’s prospects in school and beyond are particularly harmed if they have difficulties in reading and mathematics, but mathematics has received relatively little attention, compared to reading or classroom behaviour.

The number of children coming into care is increasing, but they still comprise a small percentage of all children. Many primary school teachers with a child in care placed in their class may not realise the damage that the child’s previous experience is likely to have done to their capacity to learn, making the task of assessing and teaching them much more complex than for a child with a more settled start.

This project will develop guidance for primary teachers on how to support children in care to make progress in mathematics, particularly in number and arithmetic. We will design a professional development package with three aims: 
•	to improve teachers’ understanding of barriers to learning faced by a child in care;

This research addresses the challenges confronting coffee farmers in the context of climate change. Coffee arabica is exceptionally vulnerable to climate variations, including shifts in temperature, precipitation, humidity, and light. The prevailing global warming trend intensifies concerns that suitable coffee cultivation land will significantly diminish. Additionally, the social and economic landscapes are expected to become increasingly unpredictable, potentially leading to instability in local markets and supply chains. This poses considerable risks and pressures for coffee farmers, particularly those at lower altitudes, to seek adaptive and sustainable solutions. To respond these challenges, our project adopts community-driven solutions informed by data and AI technologies.",610880,,,"Bid Submission",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",3,2024-02-01,2027-01-31,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"UKRI UK Research and Innovation UKRI","UKRI Default Scheme","Research Councils - UKRI","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"Equitable nature-based climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa",,https://www.ukri.org/opportunity/equitable-nature-based-climate-resilience-in-sub-saharan-africa/,,"2023-09-13 14:30",2250000.00,,,,,,"Winfred Onyas (MWIO1)",,,"Only people involved in this project",,"University of Huddersfield",Yes,,,,,"SS/BU: M'ing, Innov', Str'gy & Ops, Dept",,"SS/BU: M'ing, Innov', Str'gy & Ops, Dept","SS/BU: M'ing, Innov', Str'gy & Ops, Dept",,"SS/BU: M'ing, Innov', Str'gy & Ops, Dept",,,,,,,,,,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2023-09-07 16:17",,,,,,"The project is led by Dr Byongjun (Phil) Hwang, School of Applied Sciences, University of Huddersfield.

"Schizophrenia and Type 2 diabetes: incidence, life expectancy, safety/efficacy of antipsychotic therapies and the role of ethnicity",,"Background

People with schizophrenia have an increased risk of developing Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) due to a combination of genetic, medication and lifestyle factors. People from ethnic minority communities are particularly disadvantaged: Both Black and South Asian communities are individually more likely to have schizophrenia or T2DM, but we do not know if there are further risks of developing T2DM if schizophrenia is present. There are no recommended first-line antipsychotic treatments for people with schizophrenia who are at risk of developing T2DM. We need more information on this to inform prescribing, monitoring and targeted prevention strategies.

Aims and objectives

Among adults with and without schizophrenia, to investigate:

1) Incidence of developing T2DM in our cohort of people with and without schizophrenia by ethnicity. 
2) Life expectancy in people with schizophrenia and T2DM, compared to people with schizophrenia alone, T2DM alone, and neither condition, also stratified by ethnicity.

Among adults with schizophrenia only, to investigate:

3) Describe first-line prescribing of antipsychotic agents by ethnicity, BMI, gender, age and socioeconomic status.
4) Model the risk of T2DM, psychotic events, suicide/self-harm, cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality by the antipsychotic agents prescribed, also stratified by ethnicity.

Methods

This electronic health record observational study will use data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), linked with hospital episodes, mortality and deprivation data. All adults with schizophrenia and a 1:1 propensity-score matched (gender, age, ethnicity, body mass index, socioeconomic status) sample without schizophrenia in England will be included from January 2010 to the latest date available. Descriptive and time-to-event approaches will be used to calculate incidence of T2DM, life expectancy, and first-line antipsychotic therapies prescribed for schizophrenia, also investigating the effects of ethnicity (Aims 1–3). Flexible parametric approaches will be used to follow up people with schizophrenia by antipsychotic therapies prescribed to explore their effect on outcomes related to T2DM (cardiovascular disease, T2DM, deaths) and those related to schizophrenia (self-harm/suicidality, psychotic episodes, deaths) (Aim 4).

Timelines for delivery 

Months 0–3: Scientific approval submission

"Digital Innovative testiNG of BATteries",DINGBAT,"The current battery test technologies are useful only when used longer term. They require long-term testing to give useful data. The data collected is often analysed using models that are emperically incorporated into a computer programme. This makes data analysis time consuming. The diagonostic tools must recognize the battery conditions and provide reliable results, even if the charge is low. This is a demanding request as a good battery that is only partially charged behaves in a similar way to a faded pack that is fully charged. Test methods range from taking a voltage reading, to measuring the internal resistance by a pulse or AC impedance method, to coulomb counting, and to taking a snapshot of the chemical battery with Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). Capacity estimations by deciphering the chemical battery are more complex than digital monitoring by coulomb counting. Digging into the chemical battery involves proprietary algorithms and matrices that function as lookup tables similar to letter or face recognition. It is a necessity now to develop a robust and more efficient BMS with a reduced hardware to provide a more accurate useful life as well the second life data of the battery. 

Objectives of this project are to provide 

 1) To develop advanced SoX and End of Life Evaluators, capable of improved lifetime prediction by 15% over the current SoA.
2) To develop advanced algoirthms that can emulate a fully-instrumented battery pack (every cell) with reduced instrumentation and modelling without compromising accuracy. Based on first at cell level, then module level and then pack level.
3) To develop the hardware required for implementing the extra improved features; with enough interfacability to cater for most existing BMSs, based on FPGA+EIS.
4) To develop the framework necessary for constant updating and upgrading of the models, based on inputs from the  vehicle and the cloud arrangement.
5) Aiming to deliver full-scale TRL 6 demonstration of the DingBat add-on programme on two case-studies.",533304,,,"Bid Awaiting Response",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",3,2024-02-01,2027-01-31,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"CEC CEC","CEC Default Scheme","EU Government Bodies (inc European Commission but not UK)","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"HORIZON-CL5-2023-D5-01-02 (Innovative battery management systems for next generation vehicles (2ZERO & Batt4EU Partnership))",,https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/horizon-cl5-2023-d5-01-02,,"2023-04-20 17:35",,"2023-09-06 13:49",,"2024-09-05 00:00",,,"Shiladitya Paul (SP660)","Hong Dong (HD38),Gebril El-Fallah (GMAE2)","Vikas Kumar (VK115),Kranthi Maniam (KM508)","Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,,,,"SE/EN: TWI Innovation Centre",,"SE/EN: TWI Innovation Centre","SE/EN: TWI Innovation Centre",,"SE/EN: TWI Innovation Centre",,,,,,,,,,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2023-04-17 18:17",,,,,,,461534.84,461534.84,689018.61,689018.61,461534.84,461534.84,-227483.76,66.98,169399.87,36.7,91168.94,19.75,291295.26,461534.84,0.00,461534.84,0.00,461534.84,292134.98,292134.98,291295.26,461534.84,0.00,461534.84,0.00,461534.84,66847.47,32070.00,0.00,160019.18,78230.93,72983.18,8805.08,236864.45,0.00,461534.84,461534.84,689018.61,689018.61,461534.84,461534.84,-227483.76,66.98,169399.87,36.7,91168.94,19.75,"2023-09-06 13:49:27",,Discoverable,,"2023-03-31 17:32:56","Shiladitya Paul (SP660)","2023-09-06 13:52"
"DEvelopment oF tEchnologies CriTical fOR future offshore wind farms",DOCTOR,"The world's first offshore wind farm was installed of the coast of Denmark in 1991, over 30 years ago. In the past 30 years or so, the cost of installation per MW of power has steadily fallen. In terms of the Levelized Cost of Energy, an almost 55% drop is anticipated from 2018 to 2030, and 37% to 49% declines in production costs by 2050, making the offshore wind sector increasingly competitive with fossil fuels. Currently, offshore wind enery is considered a mature technology with large-scale adoption providing energy for millions of home around the world. This is considered the rich path towards carbon neutrality. The 2030 climate target plan outlined the strategy for greenhouse-gas emissions reduction by at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990. This will require a scale up of the offshore wind industry, which is estimated to require less than 3% of the European maritime space and can therefore be compatible with the goals of the EU Biodiversity Strategy [offshore renewable energy strategy (COM(2020) 741 final)]. The decarbonisation of energy production is the key to overall decarbonisation as this would support other technologies that could aid for the society to become fossil-fuel independent. Such technologies include, Hydrogen based economy (use of renewable electricity for hydrogen production). In cases where CO2 emission is inevitable such as cement production, the decarbonisation of energy generation can also aid with reduction of CO2 footprint by allowing CCS for such systems. In summary, development and deployment of large-scale offshore wind farms could accelerate decarbonisation.",519781,,,"Bid Awaiting Response",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",3,2024-01-01,2026-12-31,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"CEC CEC","CEC Default Scheme","EU Government Bodies (inc European Commission but not UK)","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"HORIZON-CL5-2023-D3-01-05: Critical technologies for the offshore wind farm of the future",,https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/horizon-cl5-2023-d3-01-05,,"2023-03-30 16:00",,"2023-09-06 13:43",,"2024-09-05 00:00",,,"Shiladitya Paul (SP660)","Gebril El-Fallah (GMAE2)","Vikas Kumar (VK115)","Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,,,,"SE/EN: TWI Innovation Centre",,"SE/EN: TWI Innovation Centre","SE/EN: TWI Innovation Centre",,"SE/EN: TWI Innovation Centre",,,,,,,,"Anna Kardas (AM565)",,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2023-03-28 15:25",,,,,,,413183.19,413183.19,591131.42,591131.42,413183.19,413183.19,-177948.23,69.9,126199.17,30.54,79518.06,19.25,286318.17,413183.19,0.00,413183.19,0.00,413183.19,286984.02,286984.02,286318.17,413183.19,0.00,413183.19,0.00,413183.19,55615.40,20400.00,0.00,112764.70,46681.10,58969.24,7114.36,191382.69,0.00,413183.19,413183.19,591131.42,591131.42,413183.19,413183.19,-177948.23,69.9,126199.17,30.54,79518.06,19.25,"2023-09-06 13:48:17",,Discoverable,,"2023-03-13 17:57:40","Shiladitya Paul (SP660)","2023-09-06 13:52"

"High performance and stable LARGE area peroVskite PhotoVoltaic modules",HELIOS,"Currently, c-Si solar cells dominate more than 90% of the PV market share because of cheap raw materials, long stability, and well-established technology. However, the limitation of c-Si PV is the complex fabrication process as well as high and therefore affect the commercialisation. As an alternative, single-junction PSC has reached 25.7% of its PCE at the laboratory scale, comparable to the first-generation monocrystalline silicon solar cell, which takes about 40 years for this level to achieve similar PCE and can be a potential low-cost alternative to c-Si. In addition to that, the perovskite-on-silicon tandem solar cell has achieved a PCE of 29.52%, with a device area of 30 cm x 30 cm and the all-perovskite tandem solar cell achieved a certified efficiency of 26.4%. However, although the efficiency and cost of PSCs are ideal for materialization, the lifetime and scale up process to fabricate the large scale module (15 cm x 10 cm ) of PSCs is yet to meet the requirements of a regular PV product.
Despite of its high efficiency form small cell (25.7% for 0.095 cm2 cell, 23.7% for 1 cm2 cell. And 22.4 for 26 cm2 minimodule), the overall stability and the cell-to-large scale module (at least 15 cm x 10 cm module) efficiency gap remains large, and a key hurdle for its commercialisation. Therefore, scaling up the device area to fabricate efficient perovskite solar modules is the necessary next step for PSCs commercial applications. To minimise this cell to module efficiency gap and to enhance the stability of module scale PSC, this proposal will bring together the key expertise and particularly focus on the

1) Development and the demonstration of a scalable method for the deposition of high-quality large-area perovskite films. Our contacted partners have already developed a very highly sable 15 cm x 10 cm PSC module with an efficiency of nearly 15%. 

2) The proposed PSC module showing a very high stability but the cost of efficiency sacrifice. Therefore, this proposal will focus on the sacrifice points to improve the efficiency uo to 25% and simultaneously will develop the fabrication process for large-area charge transporting layers and electrodes (key challenges for large area perovskite efficiency and stability). So, our contacted project partner already has the large-scale module structure. Proposal objective will be to develop and fine tune the fabrication process because we need to add the new layers to the existing structure to improve the efficiency without affecting the stability of the PSC module structure.

3) Development of more cost effective and environmental friendly substrate/electrode (alternative to ITO because that contains indium) materials for the fabrication of  PSC module 


4) In addition to improving the efficiency for commercial development of Perovskite PV, lifetime is another challenge that need to be addressed for these large-scale structures.

5) This project will develop updated test protocols and perform outdoor field performance testing of the perovskite modules as per the requirement. 

6) Overall, the project will focus to identify and tackle complex PSC module development issues related to materials (active, charge transport and electrode materials), module fabrication process, encapsulation, testing, commercialisation and circularity.

We will be developing large scale fabrication process and achieved an efficiency of ~ 15% for 15cm x 10 cm PSC module. That process will the base line for us to develop an industrial scale  method for the deposition of high-quality large-area perovskite films and electrodes.",600113,,,"Bid Submission",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",3,2024-05-01,2027-04-30,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"CEC CEC","CEC Default Scheme","EU Government Bodies (inc European Commission but not UK)","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"HORIZON-CL5-2023-D3-02-12: Large Area Perovskite solar cells and modules",,https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/horizon-cl5-2023-d3-02-12,,"2023-09-05 16:00",,,,,,,"Shiladitya Paul (SP660)","Haitao Ye (HY122),Hong Dong (HD38)","Vikas Kumar (VK115)","Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,,,,"SE/EN: TWI Innovation Centre",,"SE/EN: TWI Innovation Centre","SE/EN: TWI Innovation Centre",,"SE/EN: TWI Innovation Centre",,,,,,,,"Anna Kardas (AM565)",,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2023-09-01 13:56",,,,,,,,460228.52,,682915.70,,460228.52,-222687.18,67.39,153119.86,33.27,90877.25,19.75,306191.91,460228.52,0.00,460228.52,0.00,460228.52,307108.66,307108.66,306191.91,460228.52,0.00,460228.52,0.00,460228.52,60915.38,31100.00,0.00,142724.85,62242.60,71817.77,8664.48,233082.18,0.00,460228.52,,682915.70,,460228.52,,-222687.18,67.39,153119.86,33.27,90877.25,19.75,"2023-09-06 11:28:44",,Discoverable,,"2023-08-16 13:42:54","Shiladitya Paul (SP660)","2023-09-06 11:28"

"Zoonosis and the evolution of host genomes",,"This study will address the role of the host genome in zoonosis by using abundant knowledge of the primate malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum.  It is clear that malaria is a recent zoonosis, as the closely-related parasite P.praefalciparum has been found in wild gorillas with no pathological effects. Therefore, the parasite jumped from wild gorillas into humans approximately 10,000 years ago, and became pathogenic (1).  P.praefalciparum infects gorillas, and related Plasmodium species of the Laverinia family infecting other apes, show host-specificity in the wild, but human P.falciparum can infect chimpanzees and bonobos in captivity (2) without malarial symptoms, suggesting that genetic changes in the host genome, in addition to the parasite, underly reduced sensitivity to malaria (3, 4). Little is known about how these apes evolved resistance to malarial symptoms despite chronic and widespread infection with P.falciparum-like (Laverinia family) parasites. This project aims to answer this question.",571743,,,"Bid Awaiting Response",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",4,2024-10-01,2028-09-30,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"THE LEVERHULME TRUST The Leverhulme Trust","THE LEVERHULME TRUST Default Scheme","UK Charities (Open Competition & External Peer Review)","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,,,https://www.leverhulme.ac.uk/research-project-grants,,,500000.00,"2023-09-05 15:38",,"2024-09-04 00:00",,,"Ed Hollox (EJH33)",,,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,"Twycross Zoo - East Midlands Zoological Society Limited,University of Cambridge,University of Nottingham",,,,"LS: Genetics & Genome Biology",,"LS: Genetics & Genome Biology","LS: Genetics & Genome Biology",,"LS: Genetics & Genome Biology",,No,,,,"99 - Not Applicable for Institute reporting",,"Yelena Mazulina (YM41)",,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2023-09-05 08:24",,,,,,,383628.18,398809.60,853753.88,927026.79,383628.18,398809.60,-528217.18,43.02,-19959.24,-5,-133377.87,-33.44,398809.60,398809.60,0.00,398809.60,0.00,398809.60,418768.84,418768.84,398809.60,398809.60,0.00,398809.60,0.00,398809.60,94827.34,13000.00,0.00,214761.61,113418.63,90432.71,10910.28,293496.33,0.00,398809.60,383628.18,927026.79,853753.88,398809.60,383628.18,-528217.18,43.02,-19959.24,-5,-133377.87,-33.44,"2023-09-05 15:38:36",,Discoverable,,"2023-06-22 13:37:07","Ed Hollox (EJH33)","2023-09-12 12:18"

"Investigating the Role of Host Stress in Pneumococcal Pathogenesis",stress-strep,"When inside their host, bacteria encounter a variety of host signals including fluctuations in temperature, oxygen level and nutrient availability. One of the most prominent host signals are catecholamine (CA) stress hormones, including dopamine (Dop), epinephrine (Epi) and norepinephrine (NE) In our breakthrough study, we showed that NE-treated Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn) efficiently translocated from the nasopharynx into the lungs and increased its virulence potential. We also found that the regulatory protein TCS09 plays a role in Spn response to stress hormones. In this study, we will build upon our existing work and test the hypothesis that pneumococcal translocation from the nasopharynx into the lungs is triggered by stress hormone recognition via a complex genetic network under the environmental conditions of the respiratory tract. The objectives of this project are to 1.) Determine how chemical and nutritional factors intersect with stress hormone responses to enable a shift from commensal to an invasive phenotype. 2.) Identify the effector and regulatory mechanisms responsive to stress hormones. 3.) Evaluate the impact of stress hormones on host response to Spn and determine the in vivo importance of the pneumococcal effector and regulatory mechanisms.",605674,,,"Bid Submission",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",5,2024-07-01,2029-06-30,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"NATL INST OF HEALTH NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH","NATL INST OF HEALTH Default Scheme","Non EU (Overseas) Other (including non-competitive based charities)","YH Income - Services to Rest of World - Zero Rate",,,R01,,https://www.niaid.nih.gov/grants-contracts/overview-r01-process,,"2023-09-22 13:50",578571.00,,,,,,"Hasan Yesilkaya (HY3)",,,"Only people involved in this project",,"Carnegie Mellon University",Yes,,,,,"LS: Respiratory Sciences",,"LS: Respiratory Sciences","LS: Respiratory Sciences",,"LS: Respiratory Sciences",,,,,,"99 - Not Applicable for Institute reporting","UNITED KINGDOM,UNITED STATES","William Hudson (WOH3)",,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2023-09-04 11:33",,,,,,"Award ceiling (set by lead) is USD 150k p.a. directs, plus 8% F&A costs, i.e. $150k x 5 = $750k + 8% F&A = $810k, or £578,571k (@ 1.4 costing rate)",,578271.55,,989268.54,,578271.55,-410996.99,58.45,60318.00,10.43,8785.01,1.52,489217.96,578271.55,0.00,578271.55,0.00,578271.55,517953.54,517953.54,489217.96,578271.55,0.00,578271.55,0.00,578271.55,198131.64,138433.00,0.00,159278.00,51533.00,96145.50,11599.50,312037.00,0.00,578271.55,,989268.54,,578271.55,,-410996.99,58.45,60318.00,10.43,8785.01,1.52,"2023-09-04 11:33:03",,Discoverable,,"2023-08-29 13:42:47","Hasan Yesilkaya (HY3)","2023-09-04 11:33"

"The effectiveness and implementation of a walking exercise behaviour-change intervention: A hybrid 2 randomised controlled trial with health economic analysis (Motivating structure walking activity in intermittent claudication (MOSAIC2))",MOSAIC2,"Many older people suffer disabling leg pain due to poor circulation, called intermittent claudication. This can be treated simply by walking regularly, which few people do. This is because increasing walking exercise independently is difficult without guidance and support and supervised exercise treatment is not often available. and starting or increasing walking exercise independently is difficult without guidance and support. Working with patients and practitioners, we designed a walking exercise treatment programme that was delivered by a physiotherapist trained to help people start and continue walking at home. This treatment improved people’s walking ability and ability to do everyday activities. The treatment was liked and welcomed by patients and physiotherapists and was easy to provide in a hospital. But we do not know whether its effects last a long time, whether our treatment can be easily provided in any health care setting, such as General Practices, by any trained practitioner (e.g., nurse) and if it is good value for money.
This study aims to
a)	test whether our treatment improves walking ability, participation in everyday activities and quality of life in the longer term 
b)	investigate whether our treatment can be delivered as intended in hospitals or general practices by any trained practitioner and understand the factors that may influence it being taken up by the NHS
c)	work out if our treatment is value for money for the NHS
Our treatment, called the MOtivating Structured walking Activity in Intermittent Claudication (MOSAIC) programme, includes 2 in-person or video call meetings and up to 4 more telephone or video meetings over 3 months. In these meetings a practitioner will discuss the causes of the leg pain, benefits of walking, agree walking goals and plans, and provide a step counter, manual and exercise log. In between meetings, the patient will complete walking exercise at home.
370 people aged at least 50 years with poor leg circulation who are not walking sufficiently will complete a walking test, blood pressure, weight and height measures and questionnaires about daily activities, beliefs about symptoms and treatment, quality of life and costs with one researcher. Then, they will be allocated by play of chance, i.e. randomly, to either complete our new treatment alongside their usual care or continue with their usual care alone. The measurements and questionnaires will be repeated after 3 months and 12 months. 
All treatment meetings will be recorded, and some recordings will be assessed by researchers to see if the new treatment was provided as intended by practitioners. Patients, practitioners, and managers will complete some questionnaires about whether and how the new treatment may be included in routine care. Some patients, practitioners, and managers will be interviewed to discuss the new treatment and talk about the things that might influence the treatment being included into routine care. 
We will collect the costs of the new treatment, usual care and other patient out of pocket expenses and identify if the new treatment is value for money for the NHS.
Alongside the main study, we will also investigate (a) if a computer programme can accurately assess if the treatment was delivered as intended as well as researchers and (b) compare different ways to disseminate and mobilise the knowledge from our research with patients.
Patient representatives were involved in identifying the research topic, designing the new treatment and this study. They will be involved in every aspect of the trial including the management, practitioner training and presenting the findings and their own related experiences. We will share study updates on social media and websites and present our findings at academic, practitioner and patient forums and publish them in academic journals and magazines using different formats (e.g., videos, pictures).

"Open Educational Resources (OERs) to improve access to Secondary Education through Open Schools in the Global South",OERs4OS,"An abstract of the proposed project:
Abstract

Increasing access to, and achieving equity in basic education has been a continuing issue for many resource-poor contexts in the Global South. Several global level proclamations, most especially since the 1990s, have been made by the international agencies lead by the United Nations agencies to achieve education for all. United Nations’ declaration of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015 include a specific target on education (SDG4) which stipulates that school-age children receive free education at primary and secondary levels by 2030. However, recent estimates suggest that this target is unlikely to achieve by 2030. High costs associated with building new schools and maintaining them, and educational resources are some of the challenges for increasing access to education through conventional schooling systems.

The proposed research project aims to explore the potential of alternative approaches to providing access to education at the secondary level in the Global South. It builds on the knowledge developed and experience gained to-date on Open Educational Resources (OERs) and Open Schooling (an alternative approach to providing access to learning for those who are not able to attend formal schools for a variety of reasons) in a selected number of countries in the Commonwealth. The project is relevant to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially SDG4 on education. Working with advice and guidance from the Commonwealth of Learning, and other stake holders in Global South who are interested in improving access to education in resource-poor contexts, the outcome from the project is expected to contribute to addressing inclusivity in education from a global South perspective.",556094,,,"Bid Unsuccessful",Locked,Unsuccessful,"Palitha Edirisingha (PE27),Pre-award Admin",1,2023-10-01,2024-09-30,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"BRITISH ACADEMY The British Academy","BA/Leverhulme Small Research Grants","Research Councils (BEIS) - Roy Society and Brit Academy","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"British Academy/Leverhulme Small Research Grants",,https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/funding/ba-leverhulme-small-research-grants/,,"2023-05-31 17:00",10000.00,"2023-05-30 12:50",,"2024-05-29 00:00",,,"Palitha Edirisingha (PE27)",,,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,,,,"SS/ED: Education",,"SS/ED: Education","SS/ED: Education",,"SS/ED: Education",,,,,,,,,,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2023-05-24 16:36",,,,,,,8442.54,8442.54,35513.46,35513.46,8442.54,8442.54,-27070.92,23.77,-31.86,-0.38,-8930.79,-105.78,8442.54,8442.54,0.00,8442.54,0.00,8442.54,8474.40,8474.40,8442.54,8442.54,0.00,8442.54,0.00,8442.54,0.00,0.00,0.00,10964.43,8898.93,2065.50,0.00,16074.63,0.00,8442.54,8442.54,35513.46,35513.46,8442.54,8442.54,-27070.92,23.77,-31.86,-0.38,-8930.79,-105.78,"2023-09-01 15:42:08",,Private,,"2023-05-23 09:59:27","Palitha Edirisingha (PE27)","2023-09-01 15:42"

It involves  the surgeon placing a tiny tube, called a ‘perineural  catheter’, next to the main nerve  which is cut during surgery. Local  anaesthetic  is slowly pumped  into the tube  for  five  days. Putting  it in and  taking it out is easy and problems  are  rare.  It can replace  some  (or  all) of  the morphine  usually needed.  It may also reduce phantom pain. The study will be a ‘randomised’  trial. This means patients will be randomly chosen to either  have  surgery  with, or  without, the  tube. Everything  else will be the same.

"iDAH- Consolidating the Museum Data Service as research infrastructure",,"November 2023 will see the beta launch of the new Museum Data Service (MDS) that will, uniquely, provide the raw material for anyone wanting to work at scale with collections data from UK museums large and small. 
Most of this data is currently not online and, where it is, it rarely meets the requirements of the FAIR principles. 
Within five years, the MDS aims to bring together online – as FAIR data – the object records of at least half the country’s museums, and almost all of them within a decade.
MDS is a collaboration between Art UK, Collections Trust (CT) and the University of Leicester (UoL), with start-up funding (via Art UK) from Bloomberg Philanthropies to the end of May 2024.

"Business Takes Two: The Interaction between Self-Employment and Marriage Patterns",,"The economic literature on self-employment has emphasised that self-employment plays an important role throughout the income distribution. At the bottom of the distribution, self-employment opens up an opportunity to leave unemployment, whereas at the top of the distribution very successful starts contribute to innovation  and economic growth. The literature has typically analysed self-employment from the perspective of the individual entrepreneur while ignoring their family context.

In this project, we want to use rich administrative data to document the relationship between self-employment and marriage/partnership status in the data and use these empirical patterns as inputs to build a new macroeconomic model of self-employment from a family perspective. We expect that there are several dimensions which could play a role. First, as self-employment is associated with substantial risk about business success, the income of the partner is an important source of insurance. Second, the presence of a partner could ease credit constraints, which helps individuals start their business in the first place. Marriage has been documented to make wealth accumulation easier, and the partner of the entrepreneur also brings some own wealth to the relationship, which makes it easier for households to obtain credit. Third, couples may decide to start a business together and pool their assets and labour.

The data that will be used is the Dutch administrative microdata, which contains a lot of information on earnings and assets and allows to link individuals to other family members. The data is provided by Statistics Netherlands, who charge fees:

1) There is an initial setup cost to create a new project and for each researcher to gain access to the data.
2) In addition, there is a monthly fee for each register which is added to a project. Our project will require the following registers: wealth, jobs, basic register, income tax, unemployment benefits, self-employed income
3) Finally, exporting the data, for example for internal presentations also comes with a cost.

"BBSRC FoF APP14836: Establishing the YCharOS Inc. antibody characterisation pipeline for immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry applications",YCharOS,"Commercial antibodies are key reagents in academic, biotechnology, and pharmaceutical research, with global sales estimated at $2-3 billion USD/ann. 20-60% of antibodies on the market do not perform as required1– leading to billions of dollars of wasted funding and a crisis of experimental reproducibility. While the pharmaceutical industry tends to characterize their antibodies internally, they usually work with 1-2 antibody manufacturers, and their data remains confidential.
Despite the size of the market and the importance of the product, YCharOS Inc., a Canadian Open Science company, is the only independent, state-of-the-art quality assessment body for antibodies for use in western blotting, immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation. YCharOS have launched a unique, robust, independent, and scalable antibody characterisation platform with community-accepted standards and viable open science business model. They currently perform antibody characterisation with 11 commercial antibody manufacturers representing ~60% of antibody manufacturing globally, and two knockout cell line manufacturers. The estimated total in-kind contribution from all YCharOS partners has reached $2.5 million since 2020. So far YCharOS Inc. has received $800,000 CAD in fee for service contracts. Their current pipeline does not include immunohistochemistry (IHC) or flow cytometry (FC), commonly used applications in all research sectors. There is demand from the pharmaceutical sector for these services to be provided.
Aims and Objectives
This project will work to expand the YCharOS pipeline to include robust, independent, and scalable antibody characterisation for IHC and FC applications. This will be the first milestone towards expanding YCharOS Inc. to the UK, with the Leicester team focussed on protein targets of interest to the respiratory science community. Our medium-term aim is to establish workflows for all commonly used antibody/affinity reagent-based applications in Canada and UK, providing a commercial service to the biotech and pharmaceutical industry. 
The team in Leicester host facilities that are currently used in fee-for-service contracts and clinical trials for human IHC and FC studies with the pharmaceutical industry. Virk, Biddle and Bradding have experience in antibody validation/characterisation by IHC and FC. Virk and Biddle will be spending 1 month at YCharOS Inc. as part of an industry exchange funded via a BBSRC Impact Accelerator, and have been collaborating with the group in their academic work. This exchange will take place in January 2024 with the aim of developing technical and business skills, and strengthening the relationships, to expand the YCharOS Inc. pipeline.
In this phase of expansion, the Leicester team will receive knockout and control cell lines and antibodies from YCharOS Inc., that have been characterised for the other applications. They will use the facilities based in Leicester to optimise high-throughput antibody characterisation process, with trusted protocols and standards, for FC and IHC. They key output of this phase will be industry partner accepted protocols and high throughput processes.
The FC protocol will be adapted from existing workflows in Leicester and the immunofluorescence protocols already established by YCharOS Inc for intracellular targets. The IHC protocols will utilise formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) cell-pellets, which has been established by YCharOS Inc. This will be supplemented by staining of FFPE human tissues utilising independent antibodies that demonstrate selectivity in FFPE cell-pellets.

"A randomised controlled trial of carotid endarterectomy vs medical therapy for people with recently symptomatic carotid artery stenosis.",,"Background:

A carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is an operation to clean out narrowed arteries in the neck to prevent people having a stroke. Around 4000 CEA operations are performed in the NHS every year. CEA is usually offered to people who have had a minor stroke or experienced some other warning sign for a major stroke. People having a CEA also have medical (drug) therapy to help reduce the risk of stroke further. Medical therapy aims to keep people’s blood pressure low, thin the blood and reduce cholesterol.

The alternative to CEA is to offer people just the medical therapy. Research from the 1980s showed that surgery with medical therapy was better than medical therapy alone at preventing stroke. Medical therapy has greatly improved since the 1980s. There are new, better blood thinning and fat lowering tablets. The National Health Service (NHS) is now better at providing guidance and supporting people to take the correct tablets. This has reduced the risk of stroke in people who get modern medical therapy. We don’t know whether modern medical therapy alone is now good enough to avoid the need for CEA surgery. If it is, then continuing to offer CEA might be of no benefit or even leading to more strokes, surgical complications, and wasting NHS resources.

Aim: 

To find out if, in people who have had a minor stroke or other warning sign of a major stroke, medical therapy alone is as good at preventing strokes as CEA surgery combined with medical therapy.

Design & methods:

People who would normally be offered CEA will be asked if they want to take part in this research. They will then be randomly allocated to either get CEA and best medical therapy (standard treatment) or best medical therapy alone (new treatment). These people will be followed for at least two years. The number of people who have a stroke or die during follow up will be compared between those who were offered surgery and those who were not. Quality of life, psychological wellbeing, and NHS costs will also be compared. This research will be carried out in NHS hospitals across the UK and involve up to 1600 people. Over the course of the study the results will be regularly checked to confirm the safety of the new approach and the study stopped if there are any concerns.

Patient and public involvement:

To plan this study, we talked to people who had experienced a stroke or undergone surgery. We also ran a survey of people with strokes or narrowed neck arteries, to find out what outcomes were important to assess in the research. Two-thirds found this research acceptable and would join the study if they were invited. They advised us that providing good information to trial participants would be essential and that it would be important to compare the psychological impact of each treatment. We have included these suggestions in our research plans. We will expand this preliminary work by forming a public advisory group during the study. This group will advise the research team and provide ongoing input.

Dissemination:

Our patient group will assist with writing a plain language summary at the end of the project. We will talk to expert NHS groups, both when we are doing the study and when it is complete. At the end of the study, we will organise an event to publicise the results. The final results will be published in a medical journal and will be free to access. Results will be shown to NHS decision makers to decide which treatments are best for patients.",595419,,,"Bid Awaiting Response",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",5,2024-12-01,2029-11-30,,"RC - Research Clinical Trial",Research,,"NIHR National Institute of Health Research","NIHR Default Scheme","UK Central Government","T3 - 20% VAT on Expenditure - not recoverable,Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"23/66 NIHR James Lind Alliance Priority Setting Partnerships Rolling Call (HTA Programme)",,https://www.nihr.ac.uk/funding/2366-nihr-james-lind-alliance-priority-setting-partnerships-rolling-call-hta-programme/33324,,"2023-08-30 13:00",,"2023-08-30 08:41",,"2024-08-29 00:00",,,"Matthew Bown (MJB42)","Athanasios Saratzis (AS875),Jatinder Minhas (JM591)","Sian Baldock (SB850)","Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,"Anglia Ruskin University,Imperial College London,Partner not Listed,University Hospitals of Leicester,University of Cambridge,UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH","University of York",,"LS: Cardiovascular Sciences",,"LS: Cardiovascular Sciences","LS: Cardiovascular Sciences",,"LS: Cardiovascular Sciences",,Yes,,,,"99 - Not Applicable for Institute reporting","UNITED KINGDOM","Kerry Warner (KW153)",,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,"EoI/Outline Application (budget required)",,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Clinical medicine",,,,"Not Applicable for HEBCI","Not applicable for HEBCI",,"2023-08-25 16:13",,,,,,,2790684.74,2790684.74,3441310.44,3441310.44,3343220.92,3343220.92,-650625.70,81.09,805941.01,28.88,556020.12,19.92,1886654.22,3343220.92,0.00,3343220.92,0.00,3343220.92,1984743.73,1724750.94,1626661.43,3343220.92,0.00,3343220.92,0.00,3343220.92,841042.25,33850.00,5000.00,765174.46,249920.89,122367.00,14763.00,691392.25,0.00,2041080.25,2041080.25,2508939.83,2508939.83,2410850.31,2410850.31,-467859.58,81.35,316329.31,15.5,66408.42,3.25,"2023-08-30 08:41:57",,Discoverable,,"2023-08-07 11:00:38","Sian Baldock (SB850)","2023-08-30 08:45"

Several studies showed the importance of professional phagocytes such as macrophages and neutrophils to eradicate S. aureus in vivo infection. However, clinical infection relapse, even after antibiotic therapy, is not uncommon for S. aureus infections. This suggests that S. aureus can survive in certain niches in the human host where it is protected from the immune systems as well as antibiotic treatment.

"Development of new methodology to address the impact of poor-quality studies on meta-analysis through a research wastage perspective",,"Meta-analysis of RCTs has become the default methodology for summarising quantitative effects of healthcare interventions. Under such a framework, extensive searches for all relevant RCTs are conducted through a desire to minimise publication biases, and a common belief that combining as many studies as possible will lead to more precise results.
Tempered against this inclusivity is the concern that not all trials are conducted with equal rigour, and including poor quality trials will introduce bias into a meta-analysis. This is widely acknowledged and assessment of the quality of RCTs in a meta-analysis is recommended. However, identifying potentially biased studies, and even downgrading recommendations as a result, is only a partial solution to the problem, especially when the empirical effect estimates from a meta-analysis are of primary interest; such as when used in clinical or economic decision-making frameworks, or for justifying and designing future trials. Methods for adjusting for such biases directly in the meta-analysis do exist, but they are under-developed, time-consuming, difficult to implement and thus rarely used.
When trials with biased treatment estimates are included in a meta-analysis this can induce between-study heterogeneity and random-effects models are recommended. Somewhat counterintuitively, when heterogeneity exists in a meta-analysis, the inclusion of a future RCT will usually have very limited impact since, irrespective of size, a single study only has limited impact to influence the degree of heterogeneity. Further, when heterogeneity exists, all trials in a meta-analysis will get less weight compared to when results are homogenous.  Whilst this is accepted, the implications it has for research wastage are potentially huge. For example, consider the scenario where a limited number of (potentially small) initial RCTs are conducted with poor methodological conduct (potentially along with other good quality studies), resulting in exaggerated biased treatment effects, causing a meta-analysis including them to have induced heterogeneity. It can be shown that any new study will have little impact on the evidence-base and thus be poor value for money.  
The overall aim of this project is to quantify the negative impact biased studies can have on meta-analysis, and evaluate and further develop accessible approaches to mitigate it..
Part 1 will use simulation and the impact of precision metrics, outlined above, to establish when problems exist, and quantify and demonstrate its impact in different scenarios. 
Part 2 will then apply and compare alternative analysis approaches to the simulated datasets to quantify their ability to mitigate the problems. These will include the use of alternative synthesis approaches (based on various evidence exclusion criteria including extremeness of effect, contribution to heterogeneity or effect precision) and applying model diagnostics(such as impact per patient randomised calculated in terms of improved effect precision) 

Part 3 will consider some existing meta-analyses datasets and apply the approaches which perform best in Part 2. Whilst the “truth” is unknown for these datasets the illustration to real data will be important to motivate future further evaluation and uptake.",590969,,,"Bid Submission",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",2,2024-10-01,2025-10-31,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"NIHR National Institute of Health Research","NIHR Default Scheme","UK Central Government","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"RfPB Under-represented disciplines and specialisms highlight notice: Methodologists",,https://www.nihr.ac.uk/funding/rfpb-under-represented-disciplines-and-specialisms-highlight-notice-methodologists/33231,,"2023-09-13 13:00",150000.00,,,,,,"Nicola Cooper (NJC21)","Alex Sutton (AJS22),Clareece Nevill (CRN4)",,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,,,,"LS/HS: Population Health Sciences",,"LS/HS: Population Health Sciences","LS/HS: Population Health Sciences",,"LS/HS: Population Health Sciences",,,,,,"99 - Not Applicable for Institute reporting",,"Vicki Inchley (VLC2)",,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,"EoI/Outline Application (budget required)",,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Not Applicable for HEBCI","Not applicable for HEBCI",,"2023-08-29 08:44",,,,,,,,148389.40,,188457.78,,185486.75,-40068.38,78.74,67199.98,45.29,43162.82,29.09,78218.39,185486.75,0.00,185486.75,0.00,185486.75,81189.42,81189.42,78218.39,185486.75,0.00,185486.75,0.00,185486.75,11349.98,0.00,999.98,33514.16,24037.16,9477.00,0.00,73754.20,0.00,148389.40,,188457.78,,185486.75,,-40068.38,78.74,67199.98,45.29,43162.82,29.09,"2023-08-29 08:44:05",,Discoverable,,"2023-07-28 09:59:24","Nicola Cooper (NJC21)","2023-09-11 08:10"

"Patient Education and behaviour change interventions for people with cardiometabolic comorbidities and low educational attainment, a systematic review",PLEASR,"Cardiometabolic disease includes a number of interlinked conditions, including cardiovascular disease, obesity, cholesterol problems and type 2 diabetes. People with low educational attainment are more at risk of these conditions, and if they are diagnosed with them, tend to do worse. 

One of the most important parts of the treatment of these diseases, is adopting appropriate lifestyle changes including maintenance of a healthy weight, dietary adaptions and regular physical activity. In order to make such changes, a person first has to learn about them. Our work so far has suggested that people with low educational attainment may prefer to learn in different ways to the population as a whole and might benefit from having resources designed with them in mind. 

This study aims to use a systematic process to review the use of educational lifestyle change interventions in the population of interest to date, Understand what they have consisted of, and whether they have been beneficial.

The main aim of the project is to develop and to deliver the L2A operational processor which will be deployed in the LSTM ground segment and be used by the Agency to generate the L2A products.
To achieve this the project has the following objectives:
1. To select and define the algorithms used for the retrieval of the various parameters (LST, LSE, aerosols, TCWV…) and to improve these algorithms over the whole duration of the project,
2. To develop a prototype used as a precursor and to test any evolution of the algorithms prior to their implementation into the operational processor,
3. To define the cal/val activities, before the launch, during the phase E1 (commissioning) and during the Phase E2 (routine operations), needed to assess the performances and the quality of the operational LSTM L2A products.
4. To support the engagement of a community of users and facilitate their use of LSTM products, develop open-source library modules allowing them to process the products themselves (the prototype will also be made available to users)",493098,,,"Project Setup",Locked,Successful,"Post-award Admin",7,2023-04-01,2030-02-28,,"OH - Consultancy (OSR)",Other,,"ACRI ST","ACRI ST Default Scheme","EU Other (Including non-competitive Based Charities)","Y5 Income - Services to EU - Zero Rate",,,,,,,,,"2023-08-08 14:15",,"2024-08-07 00:00",2023-08-16,,"Darren Ghent (DJG20)",,"John Remedios (JJR8),Jasdeep Anand (JSA13)","Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,,,,"SE/PA: National Centre for Earth Obs'",,"SE/PA: National Centre for Earth Obs'","SE/PA: National Centre for Earth Obs'",,"SE/PA: National Centre for Earth Obs'",,,,,,,,"Sara Mounteney (SLM81)",,"Post-award Admin (Project Setup)","Post-award Admin","Josef Walker (JAW69)",,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ACRI-ST Contract No. LSTM L2_ACR_078-2049_UoL/23/F-IP",,,Consultancy,"Commercial Client (non-SME)",,"2023-07-11 16:48",,,,,,"The bid was submitted in October 2022 and the project team has been invited to negotiate with ESA

"Enhancing crossover formation and gene introgression in Barley",,"Barley is a major worldwide crop but breeding new varieties is constrained by the frequency and distribution of genetic crossovers that underpin crop improvement. This project aims to utilise the phenotype of barley pachytene checkpoint 2 mutants that delay the timing of meiotic recombination thus enabling crossovers to form in chromosomal regions that rarely or never recombine. We hypothesise that the mutant perturbs the stringency of DNA sequence monitoring thereby allowing recombination to take place between chromosomes from divergent species. This will enhance introgression between barley and wild relatives, thus unlocking a wider gene pool of important agronomical traits.",593306,,,"Bid Awaiting Response",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",5,2024-09-01,2029-08-31,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"THE LEVERHULME TRUST The Leverhulme Trust","THE LEVERHULME TRUST Default Scheme","UK Charities (Open Competition & External Peer Review)","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"Outline applications",,https://www.leverhulme.ac.uk/research-project-grants,,,500000.00,"2023-08-17 15:12",,"2024-08-16 00:00",,,"James Higgins (JH555)",,,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,,,,"LS: Genetics & Genome Biology",,"LS: Genetics & Genome Biology","LS: Genetics & Genome Biology",,"LS: Genetics & Genome Biology",,No,,,,"99 - Not Applicable for Institute reporting",,"Yelena Mazulina (YM41)",,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2023-08-15 15:35",,,,,,,387703.41,387703.41,895600.67,895600.67,387703.41,387703.41,-507897.26,43.29,-20858.38,-5.38,-72815.26,-18.78,372403.41,387703.41,0.00,387703.41,0.00,387703.41,408561.79,408561.79,372403.41,387703.41,0.00,387703.41,0.00,387703.41,77000.00,72000.00,0.00,175001.88,51956.88,96145.50,11599.50,312037.00,0.00,387703.41,387703.41,895600.67,895600.67,387703.41,387703.41,-507897.26,43.29,-20858.38,-5.38,-72815.26,-18.78,"2023-08-17 15:12:59",,Discoverable,,"2023-08-02 11:03:45","James Higgins (JH555)","2023-08-17 15:17"

"Using real world evidence to supplement paediatric RCTs",,"Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have long been considered the gold standard for evaluating the effectiveness of health care interventions. However, besides being expensive to run, they sometimes fail to adequately answer the research questions they were designed to address, for example because they were under-powered or were terminated early. Real-World Data (RWD) in the form of routinely collected datasets provide an alternative information source, but inherent biases are a drawback to their usage in this context. The recent development of target trial methodology aims to mitigate the biases common to RWD by applying the study design principles of randomised trials to observational data. In addition to offering a valid alternative to RCTs, there is the potential to combine target trial data with RCT data making use of all available data sources to better answer important clinical questions. This is particularly attractive when an RCT alone provides insufficient data, and there is the prospect of wasted information and patient resource, with accompanying ethical issues. To our knowledge this use has yet to be explored.

The aim of this project is to demonstrate the viability of supplementing RCT data with target trial data derived from large health care datasets, using a case study where the RCT has insufficient information to answer its research question as intended and whose interventions are already given in clinical practice. This approach will be more generally applicable to a wide range of settings where increased information can improve health care decision making.

We will take a Bayesian approach, which naturally facilitates modelling complex data from multiples sources and allows direct estimation of the probability that a health care intervention is beneficial. We will produce target trial data emulating the RCT using existing frameworks: this entails producing a study protocol that emulates the RCT protocol, within the constraints of the available observational data. A key challenge that we will address is how relative weights of the differing data sources should be derived and applied. We will assess the ease of implementation and performance of different modelling strategies: including building a joint model through linking multiple sub-models and a multi-stage modelling approach which incorporates information from the previous stage through the prior distribution.

Our case study will use RCT data from the FIRST-line support for Assistance in Breathing in Children (FIRST-ABC) study, previously conducted and successfully completed at the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre (ICNARC). The RWD will come from the Paediatric Intensive Care Audit Network (PICANet).

"Improving quality of life for people living with dementia and their care partners: the development, intervention and evaluation of a dementia specific narrative-based intervention: LEND (lived experiences narratives in dementia)",,"Dementia is a progressive and disabling condition usually with loss of memory and other thinking abilities. In the UK 850,000+
people live with dementia supported by 700,000 informal carers. The diagnosis of dementia and the associated stigma can
seriously undermine a person’s sense of identity including self-esteem, social engagement, and quality-of-life. So often people
with dementia are functioning way below their potential. This is known as 'excess disability' and is linked to increased care
costs. Lack of information and support is a particular concern for people from disadvantaged groups including ethnic minorities
and the variety of LGBT+ communities. It is an NHS, service user and global priority to improve post-diagnostic dementia
support and quality-of-life so people with dementia and carers can better understand dementia symptoms and have improved
coping strategies.

Research shows people with mental health conditions find viewing, reading or listening to peers personal stories ('narratives')
helps their own well being. The NEON study collected a series of online stories from people with lived experience of mental
health problems who contributed first-person accounts of their life events, struggles, and strengths. The NEON results showed
positive benefits and good value for money. We will adapt the NEON approach and collect a large and diverse range of
people's own stories of their experiences of dementia either personally or as a carer, and then develop a way for people to find
helpful stories so creating the Lived Experience Narratives for Dementia (LEND) Intervention. We will ensure the online storysharing
is safe and accessible. Stories will be categorised for easier navigation so that people with dementia or carers can use
a filtering system to identify personally meaningful stories from text, audio or video recordings. Then we will carry out a two
studies comparing the LEND approach with usual care, the first for people with dementia, and the second for their carers.

Our consultations from a variety of family carers and people with dementia indicated that online narratives would be very
helpful to both groups. During the consultations, people from diverse backgrounds noted the lack of suitable culturally tailored
and appropriate information after dementia diagnosis. Our previous work found that people with younger onset or rarer
dementia may find such shared stories especially valuable Our Lived Experience Advisory Panel (LEAP) will be provided with
training and support in patient and public involvement (PPI), research skills and cultural competence training to
support involvement. LEAP members will include include a representatives who self-identify as Black, South Asian and
LGBT+.The research team and LEAP will work together to collect data, interpret results, help develop: the LEND Intervention,

Additionally, ECRs like me will potentially benefit from the different training resources they provide, access to journal articles/books and discounted publication charges if we choose to publish with them. Being a part of the ambassador programme would create opportunities to network with academic and research professionals across the globe and potentially lead to collaborative projects of interdisciplinary nature.

"Wordsworth in India: Understanding the Colonial Legacies of English Literature",WI,"'Wordsworth in India' explores the influence of Wordsworth's poetry and the Wordsworth family on the educational and administrative cultures of late nineteenth-century India. While recent research has shown how closely the poet's family was linked with Indian affairs (Bergsen, 2019), and how Wordsworth's poetry played a role in the history of India's colonial administration (Kennedy, 2020), an important story that remains to be told is the contribution of Wordsworth's grandsons to this history. Drawing on untranscribed documents in the Wordsworth Museum, Grasmere, in the British Library, and in private collections in the UK, USA and India, the project focusses on John Wordsworth's (1837-1927) role as a soldier involved in the suppression of the First Indian War for Independence and William Wordsworth's (1835-1917) work as Professor of English Literature and moral philosophy at Elphinstone and Deccan colleges in the 1860s, and his services as Principal and Vice-Chancellor of Bombay University from 1875 until his retirement in 1890. Through consideration of John's letters and his sketches of Indian subjects, the project will examine how his depiction of colonial India was influenced by his grandfather's writings, how his duties as a soldier were understood by his family and social circles, and how attitudes to British involvement in India were reconfigured following the collapse of the East India Company and the formation of the British Raj in 1874. The project will then go on to consider how William drew on his grandfather's work to inform the content and design of the college and university curriculums and the development of his support for the cause of Indian independence. To address these aims, the PI will need time to read and transcribe a selection of handwritten documents and consult a range of primary and secondary materials with a view to completing a c.10,000-word article for submission to the international Wordsworth Circle journal in the summer of 2025. As a majority of the documents are held in the Wordsworth Museum, the project will assist in the museum's efforts to decolonise its collections and will form a valuable adjunct to the museum's current AHRC-funded research network 'Addressing the Histories and Legacies of Empire in Literary House Museums: Dove Cottage and Beyond', of which the PI is a member. By examining the Wordsworth family's complex history of military, administrative and educational involvement in India, the project will advance understanding of the colonial and postcolonial legacies of English literature. Liaison with Corinne Fowler, whose Colonial Countryside project is an important touchstone for the project, as well as with Jeff Cowton at the Wordsworth Museum, along with academics and librarians in Mumbai and Pune, will bring significant benefits in terms of creating the conditions for further collaborative work exploring the relations between English literary culture and the maintenance and dissolution of Empire. The potential for development of the research will be explored in an online interactive workshop at the project's close, with key findings disseminated via short pieces offered to The Conversation and the Times Literary Supplement.",597611,,,"Bid Awaiting Response",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",1,2024-10-01,2025-01-31,,"RF - Research Fellowship",Research,,"AHRC Arts & Humanities Research Council","AHRC Default Scheme","Research Councils - AHRC","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"Curiosity Award",,https://www.ukri.org/opportunity/ahrc-responsive-mode-curiosity-award/,,"2023-10-19 09:55",100000.00,"2023-08-15 15:17",,"2024-08-14 00:00",,,"Philip Shaw (PS14)",,,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,,,,"SS/AR: English",,"SS/AR: English","SS/AR: English",,"SS/AR: English",,,,,,"99 - Not Applicable for Institute reporting",,,,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2023-08-13 13:11",,,,,,"The project duration is 4 months.

"Talking Animals: Teaching Human and Animal Relations in the Middle Ages",THARMA,"How did medieval people think and feel about the animals they lived and worked with? What can we in the twenty first century learn from attitudes towards non-human organisms before the industrialisation of farming and advent of mass transportation? This project sets out not to answer these questions, but to provoke discussion of them. It will make available a series of valuable but neglected Middle English texts in a freshly-edited, open-access edition. These pieces have been selected for their complexity and the range of ways with which they engage with the animal world, showing how profoundly creatures were entangled in the emotional, material, philosophical and moral lives of premodern people. It will also be accompanied by a pack of teaching materials, including classroom exercises and lesson-plans involving the texts, in order to facilitate reflection on the important questions they raise about how we conceive and approach the animal world today.",598344,,,"Bid Submission",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",1,2024-10-01,2025-09-30,,"RF - Research Fellowship",Research,,"BRITISH ACADEMY The British Academy","Mid-Career Fellowship","Research Councils (BEIS) - Roy Society and Brit Academy","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,,,https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/funding/mid-career-fellowships/,,"2023-08-23 23:45",152000.00,,,,,,"Ben Parsons (BP62)",,,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,,,,"SS/AR: English",,"SS/AR: English","SS/AR: English",,"SS/AR: English",,,,,,,,,,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2023-08-15 12:56",,,,,,,,124505.60,,155971.62,,155632.00,-31466.02,79.83,32557.98,26.15,32557.98,26.15,91608.00,155632.00,0.00,155632.00,0.00,155632.00,91947.62,91947.62,91608.00,155632.00,0.00,155632.00,0.00,155632.00,300.00,0.00,0.00,7290.00,0.00,7290.00,0.00,56734.00,0.00,124505.60,,155971.62,,155632.00,,-31466.02,79.83,32557.98,26.15,32557.98,26.15,"2023-08-15 12:56:16",,Private,,"2023-08-11 23:41:54","Ben Parsons (BP62)","2023-08-18 10:12"

"Labour Markets under Strain: UK Employment and the Pandemic",,"Covid-19 brought to the fore debates about contemporary employment. Understanding labour markets is central to this discourse. Labour markets feature at least tacitly in discussions surrounding the precarious nature of work deemed “essential” in the pandemic; state interventions that ensured the continuity of employment relations for many firms and workers; the high profile of the “gig economy”, characterised by apparently novel forms of self-employment; and debates about a supposed “great resignation” or a rise in “quiet quitting” in the wake of the pandemic. Through a quantitative analysis of Labour Force Survey data, this research will explore the evolution of labour markets in the UK before, during and after the global health emergency associated with the pandemic. The research will add to debates on the political economy of labour markets and the extent to which the pandemic has transformed employment or accelerated existing trends.",589262,,,"Bid Awaiting Response",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",1,2024-09-01,2025-08-31,,"RF - Research Fellowship",Research,,"BRITISH ACADEMY The British Academy","Mid-Career Fellowship","Research Councils (BEIS) - Roy Society and Brit Academy","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"Mid-career fellowship",,https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/funding/mid-career-fellowships/,,"2023-08-23 17:00",190000.00,"2023-08-14 08:27",,"2024-08-13 00:00",,,"Joseph Choonara (JC770)",,,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,,,,"SS/BU: Work, Emp, M'ment & Org, Dept",,"SS/BU: Work, Emp, M'ment & Org, Dept","SS/BU: Work, Emp, M'ment & Org, Dept",,"SS/BU: Work, Emp, M'ment & Org, Dept",,,,,,"99 - Not Applicable for Institute reporting",,,,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Business & management studies",,,,,,,"2023-08-09 13:27",,,,,,,122409.08,122409.08,153307.91,153307.91,153011.35,153011.35,-30898.83,79.85,33125.17,27.06,33125.17,27.06,88987.35,153011.35,0.00,153011.35,0.00,153011.35,89283.91,89283.91,88987.35,153011.35,0.00,153011.35,0.00,153011.35,9432.00,0.00,0.00,7290.00,0.00,7290.00,0.00,56734.00,0.00,122409.08,122409.08,153307.91,153307.91,153011.35,153011.35,-30898.83,79.85,33125.17,27.06,33125.17,27.06,"2023-08-14 08:27:48",,Discoverable,,"2023-07-25 11:59:43","Joseph Choonara (JC770)","2023-08-14 08:27"

"AISP: AI Empowered Social Prescribing: impact-driven personalised care and wellbeing",AISP,"There is an increasing need to provide home and community-centred approaches to healthcare, such as Social Prescribing (SP) which ameliorates the recent UK government's efforts1 to address health inequalities by bringing together healthcare and community services to respond to patients' non-medical needs. Technology and AI-empowered solutions including machine learning of personal preferences have the potential to tackle these issues by expanding the use of community-based preventative and direct interventions, reducing health inequalities within a local area by reaching out to vulnerable individuals with deteriorating conditions that keep them in continuous care and often experience exacerbations.  

The vision of this CDT is to foster a regional AI community across key East midland (EM) organisations together, to co-develop and implement AI-empowered solutions for SP at both the personal and community levels with real-life impact. To ensure the adoption of solutions derived from CDT research output, we propose a unique configuration that each of our CDT projects will have a co-sponsoring organisation, that will 1) act as the “problem owner” to co-define industry challenges with the CDT core team; 2) appoint a staff member as the industry advisor for their CDT project(s); 3) Contribute 25% financially to the co-defined project; 4). Provide the testbed to launch, test and feedback on the research output. With such configuration, each CDT project will be considered as a lean start-up team, led by the doctorate candidates (as CEO), with a core team containing a main academic adviser, an industry advisor and a secondary academic adviser.",502279,,,"Bid Awaiting Response",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",9,2024-04-01,2032-09-30,,"TS - Studentship",Studentship,,"UKRI UK Research and Innovation UKRI","UKRI Doctoral Training Centre","Research Councils - UKRI","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"UKRI Centres for Doctoral Training in artificial intelligence",,https://www.ukri.org/opportunity/ukri-centres-for-doctoral-training-in-artificial-intelligence/,,"2023-02-23 16:00",,"2023-08-01 09:55",,"2024-02-23 00:00",,,"Shigang Yue (SY237)",,"Alex Goddard (AJG29)","Only people involved in this project",,"Nottingham Trent University",Yes,,,,,"SE/CM: Computing Sciences",,"SE/CM: Computing Sciences","SE/CM: Computing Sciences",,"SE/CM: Computing Sciences",,,,,,"99 - Not Applicable for Institute reporting",,"Sara Mounteney (SLM81)",,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,"Full Application",,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2023-07-12 11:40",,,,,,"AISP lead is NTU

"Gaze and memory for real-life episodes in older and young adults",AtTrack,"We rely on visual information to navigate safely and memorise landmarks to orient ourselves in the world. As
we grow older, changes to our visual system and mobility mean we interact differently with the environment.
Investigating how these changes impact memory of natural scenes is challenging. This project will integrate
the use of eye-tracking and artificial intelligence (AI) to test people’s short-term memory of the episodes they
just experienced. We will measure where young and older adults look as they walk on the street and test their
recollection of events. Measuring visual memory during natural behaviour will help us understand how different
groups of people interact with their visual environment and remember its features. This project will significantly
advance our understanding of the effect of ageing on visual memory during natural behaviour and will provide

"Roman Era Worldings: Rethinking the Everyday in the Roman Period",EverydayRomWorld,"This project is an investigation of the archaeology of the Roman world through a critical analysis and evaluation of the everyday in the Roman past through the use of archaeological datasets. The discipline of archaeology concerns the study of people’s lives in the past but whilst the ‘everyday’ constitutes perhaps 95% of our lives it has received little critical study and is simply a natural background to ‘grander’ themes such as the economy, death and burial and identity. Understanding the ‘everyday’ however is fundamental in Roman archaeology for addressing key issues relating to the impact of the expanding Empire on the provinces and evaluating the nature of social continuity and change. A critical ‘everyday’ emphasises another Roman past with a different set of relationships between the mundane and extraordinary compared with our lives in the present. There were also different attitudes to the people living their lives including slaves, provincial peoples and elites. The analysis of archaeological data allows us to move away from established assumptions on the everyday and will be organised around three scales and based on the northwest provinces of the Empire. The first scale will concern a critical evaluation of ‘mundane’ objects in the study region: pottery and coins. The next scale will concern public, domestic, work and religious space and activities in urban and rural contexts. These activities and, the lives and experiences they represent, have tended to be taken for granted in the past. The next scale will relate to the everyday in wider landscapes examining the context of settlements through landscape archaeology. This will all come together in the largest scale to evaluate the meaning of this activity – exploring the social and economic context through the Roman period; continuity and change through the Roman period through the issue of the everyday. This approach to the everyday, a major component of people’s lives in the past, will be discipline-transforming and establish new priorities for studying and interpreting Roman archaeology.",596583,,,"Bid Development",,Pending,"Adam Rogers (ACR16),Pre-award Admin",3,2024-09-01,2027-08-31,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"AHRC Arts & Humanities Research Council","AHRC Default Scheme","Research Councils - AHRC","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Adam Rogers (ACR16)",,,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,,,,"SS/AH: Archaeology & Ancient History",,"SS/AH: Archaeology & Ancient History","SS/AH: Archaeology & Ancient History",,"SS/AH: Archaeology & Ancient History",,,,,,,,,,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,866730.91,,1122254.35,,1083413.64,-255523.44,77.23,320514.72,36.98,320514.72,36.98,507375.49,1083413.64,0.00,1083413.64,0.00,1083413.64,546216.20,546216.20,507375.49,1083413.64,0.00,1083413.64,0.00,1083413.64,1440.00,0.00,0.00,65589.75,0.00,65589.75,0.00,510448.41,0.00,866730.91,,1122254.35,,1083413.64,,-255523.44,77.23,320514.72,36.98,320514.72,36.98,"2023-08-09 13:59:04",,Private,,"2023-08-09 10:35:36","Adam Rogers (ACR16)","2023-08-09 14:10"

"Self-management support to enhance work ability in people with long-term health conditions and disabilities.",,"This award will look at how workers with long-term health problems and disabilities, including cancer, arthritis, hearing loss, and
poor mental health, can be supported to self-manage at work. Self-management describes the actions people take to help them
stay well. For example, taking medication, exercising, or getting help from friends or family when required. Our aim is to carryout workshops and other activities to understand how employers can support self-management to improve health and quality of
working life. This information will be used to develop a larger funding bid for the NIHR Research Collaboration Award scheme.

Background
There are 13 million workers in the UK with long-term health problems or disabilities. To help people stay well at work, the UK
government and professional groups want employers to support workers to self-manage their health. Yet, there is no specific
advice for employers to help them achieve this goal. Our own research has shown that workers want employers to provide self-management support, but they do not receive it. This is because employers do not know about self-management or how to
offer it.
We have developed a guide (or model) that outlines how workplaces can offer self-management support. The model was co-developed with employers and workers with long-term health problems. The model includes key areas of self-management
support, such as how workers can tell their employers about their health needs and how employers can be prepared to meet
these needs. This model now needs to be turned into tools, such as web- or paper-based information resources, to help people
with long-term health problems and disabilities self-manage their health so that they can maintain or improve their work ability.

Design and methods
Through workshops, we will bring together different groups of researchers, employers, civil servants, healthcare professionals,
and workers. These workshops will help us work-out the best ways to turn our model into tools that can help improve workplace
self-management. These workshops will also help us bring together a team of people who will work together on the Research
Collaboration Award.

Patient and public involvement
The research team will include 12 workers with diverse lived experiences who have different long-term health problems and
disabilities. This will make sure the research meets their needs and is easily understood by everyone. They will be involved in
all parts of the research project, including writing reports, leading workshops, and planning the future funding bid.

Dissemination
We will share a report from our project, including how employers can best offer self-management support with other workers,
employers, the government, professional groups, and researchers. This work will also inform our NIHR Research Collaboration
Award, which will involve projects that aim to develop and assess workplace self-management support tools",591816,,,"Bid Awaiting Response",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",1,2023-09-01,2024-06-30,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"NIHR National Institute of Health Research",,"UK Central Government","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"Work & Health: Development Awards",,https://www.nihr.ac.uk/documents/work-and-health-development-awards-research-specification/32764,,"2023-08-08 17:00",,"2023-08-09 08:46",,"2024-08-08 00:00",,,"Charlotte Edwardson (CE95)",,,"Only people involved in this project",,"Loughborough University",Yes,,,,,"LS/HS: Diabetes",,"LS/HS: Diabetes","LS/HS: Diabetes",,"LS/HS: Diabetes",,,,,,,,"Thomas Barson (TB199)",,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2023-08-02 13:30",,,,,,"This project is being led by Loughborough University.

"Why look back? Contemporary Art & Institutional Memory",,"This seminar aims to identify, draw together, and critically reflect on a growing field of practice -namely, non-collecting contemporary art institutions working with their pasts to generate new exhibitions, projects, public programmes and historical narratives. 
An ‘institutional memory’ - formed by archives, recollections, and wider collective knowledge - has distinct importance for art institutions whose longevity, value and stake in history are not secured by a permanent collection. The potential of institutional memory as a resource for new activities has become apparent over the past decade: organisations across Britain – for example 198; Arnolfini; Bluecoat; Chisenhale; CCA; Ikon and Modern Art Oxford - have taken collaborative doctorates, funded projects and significant anniversaries as opportunities to emphasise the significance of previous exhibitions or projects and activate this past by recovering marginalised histories, commissioning new work, confronting prior connections to regimes of power and violence, and inviting former publics to share and discuss their own recollections and archives. 
Despite this, there has been no collective or open consideration of what innovations, limitations and further debates have arisen through practices of reflection, retrospection, and re-activation. The seminar will thus re-group artists, curators and researchers engaged in and concerned with the ethics, practices, and potential of institutional memory, to focus on the following questions:  

•	What is the potential of institutional memory as a basis for public engagement, curatorial innovation, and organisational development within non-collecting institutions?

•	To what extent has engagement with institutional memory broadened our understanding of histories of contemporary art and revealed the historical conditions under which art and creative practice is valued?

"Copy of Contrast-free evaluation of scarring within the heart using cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging",CONFIRM,"Heart disease costs the NHS over £9billion annually.  Each year, over 100,000 people suffer a heart attack, resulting in permanent scarring of their heart. Survivors are at increased risk of sudden death or developing heart failure, a debilitating condition. Currently, doctors do not have very good tools to predict who will and will not develop complications.   

Pictures of ‘scarring’ within the heart can be obtained using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), after giving patients a ‘dye’ (a gadolinium compound). This provides an accurate method to identify even small heart attacks. However, giving this dye adds cost, and it is not safe in some people (with advanced kidney disease or allergic reactions); its long-term effects are also currently unknown. Moving ‘cine’ images of the heart are routinely acquired, and do not require any dye to be given. Hence, it would be advantageous to use these dye-free images to identify scar. This project aims to develop and test a fully automatic computer program using artificial intelligence (AI) to ‘convert’ the dye-free images into scar images. Hence, a new method to identify scarring within the heart will be developed and validated.",580512,,,"Bid Awaiting Response",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",2,2025-01-01,2026-12-31,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"UKRI UK Research and Innovation UKRI","UKRI Default Scheme","Research Councils - UKRI",,,,"Artificial intelligence innovation to accelerate health research",,https://www.ukri.org/opportunity/ukri-cross-research-council-responsive-mode-pilot-scheme/,,,750000.00,"2023-08-08 10:16",,"2024-08-07 00:00",,,"Gerry McCann (GPM12)","Shuihua Wang (SW546),Ranjit Arnold (JRA14)","Kerry Warner (KW153),Sally Utton (SU47)","Only people involved in this project",,,,,"King's College London,University of Birmingham",,,"LS: Cardiovascular Sciences","Computing and Mathematical Sciences","Computing and Mathematical Sciences,LS: Cardiovascular Sciences","LS: Cardiovascular Sciences","SE/CM: Computing Sciences","LS: Cardiovascular Sciences,SE/CM: Computing Sciences",,No,,,,"99 - Not Applicable for Institute reporting",,"Yusuf Dedat (YD134)",,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2023-07-27 20:33",,,,,,,654412.98,654412.98,855211.26,855211.26,818016.22,818016.22,-200798.28,76.52,215393.07,32.91,136327.47,20.83,404871.07,818016.22,0.00,818016.22,0.00,818016.22,439019.91,438819.91,404671.07,818016.22,0.00,818016.22,0.00,818016.22,154224.70,7200.00,0.00,198317.23,79065.61,60090.94,7249.69,217874.13,0.00,594443.38,594443.38,780249.26,780249.26,743054.22,743054.22,-185805.88,76.19,155623.47,26.18,76557.87,12.88,"2023-08-08 10:16:31",,Discoverable,,"2023-07-10 11:03:30","Sally Utton (SU47)","2023-08-08 10:16"

"Confirming and embedding patient value within an AI-enabled nAMD treatment monitoring intervention for implementation",,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the commonest cause of blindness in the UK and improving monitoring is a priority for the James Lind Alliance. It can be divided into ‘wet’ and ‘dry’ subtypes and since 2008 there has been an approved treatment for wet AMD, involving a series of injections into the eye at clinician-led intervals. Some patients do not receive the full potential of these injections due to inadequate ophthalmology service capacity to deliver timely treatment. With increasing clinical demand, this avoidable sight loss is set to increase, along with AMD’s significant impact on health care resources within the NHS.

To improve capacity and efficiency for AMD care, new health care technologies have come to market. These include an artificial intelligence (AI) tool to monitor disease activity in wet AMD and streamline clinical decisions on injection intervals. A recent single-centre NIHR-funded mixed methods study found that such independent AI-enabled treatment decisions appeared superior to observed real-world clinic decisions. This superiority was regarding patients’ stated priority of sight preservation.

The same mixed methods study also analysed interview transcripts from patients, carers and other stakeholders to draft an AI-enabled intervention for wet AMD treatment monitoring, and strategies for its implementation. Broad acceptance and opportunities to improve patients’ equity of access to care through AI emerged, but their exploration was limited by low participant diversity at the single site. We will address this through focus groups in varied settings across the UK, recruiting diverse individuals with wet AMD and those close to them. These focus groups will seek to confirm and extend our understanding of the value proposition of AI for wet AMD patients, and intervention features which best deliver it. Consultant medical retina specialists hold central influence in local implementation success. Interviews with these clinical leaders in diverse AMD services across the UK will be performed to help shape an intervention that is not just patient-centred, but nationally implementable.",594931,,,"Bid Submission",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",1,2024-05-01,2025-04-30,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"NIHR National Institute of Health Research","NIHR Default Scheme","UK Central Government","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"Research for Patient Benefit (RfPB) Progamme",,https://www.nihr.ac.uk/documents/rfpb-under-represented-disciplines-and-specialisms-highlight-notice-methodologists-call-specification/33366#funding,,"2023-08-16 17:00",,,,,,,"Gregory Maniatopoulos (GM369)",,,"Only people involved in this project",,"University of Newcastle-upon-Tyne",Yes,,,,,"SS/BU: Work, Emp, M'ment & Org, Dept",,"SS/BU: Work, Emp, M'ment & Org, Dept","SS/BU: Work, Emp, M'ment & Org, Dept",,"SS/BU: Work, Emp, M'ment & Org, Dept",,,,,,,,,,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2023-08-05 03:39",,,,,,,,8108.00,,10135.00,,10135.00,-2027.00,80,8108.00,100,1174.20,14.48,0.00,10135.00,0.00,10135.00,0.00,10135.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,10135.00,0.00,10135.00,0.00,10135.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,7298.30,6933.80,364.50,0.00,2836.70,0.00,8108.00,,10135.00,,10135.00,,-2027.00,80,8108.00,100,1174.20,14.48,"2023-08-05 03:39:54",,Private,,"2023-08-04 11:36:28","Gregory Maniatopoulos (GM369)","2023-09-05 14:22"

"HORIZON-HLTH-2023-DISEASE-03-07:Relationship between infections and non-communicable diseases",DIAMANT,"The body responds to infection by altering its metabolism to support energy intensive immunological protective pathways, this response should return to normal as infection is cleared. In Mtb infection, the bacteria are not cleared but are contained locally and continue to drive immunological and inflammatory responses with the potential to disrupt metabolic homeostasis. This is an important issue because one quarter of the world’s population is latently infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)(latent TB), and 5% of these are at risk of developing TB2 (active TB). Diabetes is a critical risk factor for TB3 and is associated with higher mortality and poorer treatment outcomes to TB4. Importantly, prediabetes is higher in TB patients5 and TB diagnosis often highlights changes in glucose homeostasis with hyperglycaemia and insulin resistance being recorded6-7. Indeed, many TB patients have abnormal fasting glucose trajectories or transient hyperglycaemia during treatment4. These observations raise the question: To what extent does infection with Mtb interfere with glucose metabolism and metabolic homeostasis?  In the progression to type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance is the first sign of disrupted glucose metabolism, prediabetes is insulin resistance accompanied by glucose intolerance and this becomes diabetes when glucose blood levels remain high8. In this WP we will define how Mtb infection impacts glucose metabolism and metabolic homeostasis. We will use mouse models to define cellular and molecular pathways within a defined and manipulatable model system. We will integrate these data with focused experimental studies in latently infected subjects as well as those with active TB.",518692,,,"Bid Unsuccessful",Locked,Unsuccessful,"Andrea Cooper (AMC72),Andrea Koekemoer (ALM19),Holly Reilly (HLR21),Janet Harris (JH68),John Pearl (JEP38),Manish Pareek (MP426),Pranabashis Haldar (PH62),Pre-award Admin,Thomas Yates (TY20)",4,2024-01-01,2027-12-31,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"CEC CEC","CEC Default Scheme","EU Government Bodies (inc European Commission but not UK)","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"HORIZON-HLTH-2023-DISEASE-03-07:Relationship between infections and non-communicable diseases",,https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/horizon-hlth-2023-disease-03-07,,"2023-04-13 16:00",,"2023-04-13 09:15",,"2024-04-12 00:00",,,"Andrea Cooper (AMC72)","John Pearl (JEP38),Pranabashis Haldar (PH62),Thomas Yates (TY20),Manish Pareek (MP426)","Janet Harris (JH68),Holly Reilly (HLR21),Andrea Koekemoer (ALM19)","Only people involved in this project",,"Stichting Tuberculosis Vaccine Initiative",Yes,,"Leiden University","Brunel University London,University of Oxford",,"LS: Respiratory Sciences",,"LS: Respiratory Sciences","LS: Respiratory Sciences",,"LS: Respiratory Sciences",,,,,,,,,,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2023-04-18 16:29",,,,,,"This is lead by TBVI in Netherlands (Marit and Elly - Janet).

"Evaluating the regional implementation of the Passport to my Health and Well-being across primary care, mental health and cancer services",,"Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind in partnership with Macmillan have been exploring the experiences of people who live with mental health conditions and are subsequently affected by cancer. Based on information gathered from people with lived experience of mental health conditions and cancer, their carers and health professionals, a passport has been co-produced by members of the Macmillan Mental Health Cancer Co-production Group. The Passport is designed to help people with mental health conditions who are subsequently affected by cancer or a long term health condition to cope with attending appointments and treatment. It enables patients to record and share important information about their feelings, their cancer diagnosis and treatment with their healthcare team and support networks. In addition, the Passport provides patients with practical support, help and guidance on their cancer journey. 

This project aims to evaluate the implementation of the ‘Passport to my Health and Well-being’ across primary care, mental health and cancer services within the Cumbria and North East region to understand the impact it has on the experiences of people living with pre-existing mental health conditions and who subsequently are affected by cancer. In so doing the objectives are:

•	To understand the barriers and facilitators to implementation

"3D recoverable and reconfigurable functional  Electronic  Assemblies",VERTICAL,"The vision of this project (Fig. 1) is to develop a sustainability-driven circuit assembly paradigm which co-integrates functionality, design for informed disassembly, that provide an immediate solution to reducing emissions and elevated e-waste problem (Gen 2) whilst providing a longer-term sustainable solution where Design for Deconstruction and Dematerialisation is embedded within the design process (Gen 3). VERTICAL will therefore experiment with a range of creative combinations to discover and demonstrate the most suitable choices as sub-solutions/sub-systems to solve the complex System of Systems challenges posed for sustainable electronics and ICT manufacture. The transition to a fully sustainable manufacturing model requires a step change integrated strategy, that both disrupts the traditional linear electronics manufacturing flow, while incrementally transforming the industry’s approach to electronic design, preserving backward compatibility and upskilling future designers. VERTICAL uses circuit assemblies, moving from solely being an interconnect, as a functional and active platform which allows electronic systems to be designed and disassembled sustainably, and linking this to the creation of new supply chain actors engaged in the circular economy.",592512,,,"Bid Development",,Pending,"Andy Abbott (APA1),Jack Allen (JA462),Karl Ryder (KSR7),Pre-award Admin",3,2024-09-01,2027-08-31,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"EPSRC EPSRC ENG.& PHYS.SCIENCES R C","EPSRC Default Scheme","Research Councils - EPSRC","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Andy Abbott (APA1)","Karl Ryder (KSR7)","Jack Allen (JA462)","Only people involved in this project",,"University of Glasgow",Yes,,,,,"SE/CH: Materials & Interfaces",,"SE/CH: Materials & Interfaces","SE/CH: Materials & Interfaces",,"SE/CH: Materials & Interfaces",,,,,,,,,,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,451152.21,,577738.64,,563940.27,-126586.43,78.09,239017.93,52.98,155812.37,34.54,198335.91,563940.27,0.00,563940.27,0.00,563940.27,212134.29,212134.29,198335.91,563940.27,0.00,563940.27,0.00,563940.27,34000.00,18000.00,0.00,155688.56,83205.56,64679.70,7803.30,209915.80,0.00,451152.21,,577738.64,,563940.27,,-126586.43,78.09,239017.93,52.98,155812.37,34.54,"2023-08-01 14:54:46",,Private,,"2023-08-01 14:48:39","Andy Abbott (APA1)","2023-08-10 12:05"

"Does the epigenetic clock regulate early life environmental exposures' effects on lifespan and healthspan?",,"This project will help understand the proximate causes of life history evolution by establishing the effect of larval diapause on insect epigenetic ageing. This extends our discovery of epigenetics’s role in several insect life history traits (1). Why individuals and species age so differently is one of the biggest unanswered questions in evolutionary biology (2).
Environments can be variable and organisms can be selected to sense the state of their environ- ment early in life and to adaptively adjust their life history in response to these changes (3). The ability of one genotype to produce different life-histories depending on the environment is known as a life-history polyphenism (3). We ask could epigenetics and specifially the epigenetic clock be a proximate mechanism of these life-history polyphenisms.
An epigenetic clock is a biochemical test based on measuring the accumulation of chemical marks (DNA methylation) to DNA molecules (4). There is evidence epigenetic age mirrors true biological age and its associated morbidity and mortality better than chronological age (5). The rate at which an epigenetic clock ticks is strongly affected by the environment. This seems especially true in the early stages of life (6). This gives rise to the idea that an epigenetic clock can be developmentally tuned as part of an adaptive response to environmental variables experienced during development (6).
Aging is a complex process influenced by many environmental and genetic components. The effects of these components influence each other making them difficult to investigate, especially in complex mammalian models. Therefore, a large body of ageing research is based on simple model invertebrate organisms (7, 8). Advantages include easy and cheap to keep in a laboratory, short lifespan, genetic and molecular tools available, and a sequenced genome. However, the current invertebrate models of ageing (Drosophila (9) and C. elegans (10)) do not possess detectable DNA methylation, reducing their generality.
The jewel wasp, Nasonia vitripennis, an emerging model system (11) has a functional methylation system (12) making it an ideal system to investigate the epigenetics of ageing. We therefore mea- sured chronological ageing and changes in the epigenome using whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) in order to discover if Nasonia vitripennis possessed an epigenetic clock. The epigenetic age of each replicate is the weighted average of each genes’ methylation state. This epigenetic age does indeed correlate with chronological age (13). This is similar to results found in many vertebrates (6). However, this is the first time an epigenetic clock has been discovered in a tractable insect model.
An example of a life-history polyphenism in Nasonia is larval diapause, an overwintering stage where development is arrested and adult lifespan is increased (14). DNA methylation is involved in Nasonia diapause (15). Using published RNA-seq datasets (16), we have found an increase in the expression of DMNT1a (the enzyme responsible for DNA methylation maintenance) and a decrease in TET (the enzyme that removes methylation) in diapaused versus non-diapaused larvae. This suggests a maintenance of DNA methylation during diapause.",585783,,,"Bid Awaiting Response",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",3,2025-01-06,2027-10-05,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"JOHN TEMPLETON FOUND John Templeton Foundation","JOHN TEMPLETON FOUND Default Scheme","Non EU (Overseas) Based Charities (Open Competition & External Peer Review)","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"2023 Funding Cycle",,https://www.templeton.org/funding-areas/genetics,,"2023-08-18 17:00",,"2023-07-28 09:06",,"2024-07-27 00:00",,,"Eamonn Mallon (EBM3)","Charalambos Kyriacou (CPK)",,"Only people involved in this project",,,,,,,,"LS: Genetics & Genome Biology",,"LS: Genetics & Genome Biology","LS: Genetics & Genome Biology",,"LS: Genetics & Genome Biology",,No,,,,"99 - Not Applicable for Institute reporting",,"Yelena Mazulina (YM41)",,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2023-07-26 16:11",,,,,,,475716.51,475716.51,718472.37,718472.37,475716.51,475716.51,-242755.86,66.21,55822.61,11.73,-1381.21,-0.29,418797.29,475716.51,0.00,475716.51,0.00,475716.51,419893.90,419893.90,418797.29,475716.51,0.00,475716.51,0.00,475716.51,135235.20,46560.00,0.00,119157.20,57203.82,55283.66,6669.71,179421.27,0.00,475716.51,475716.51,718472.37,718472.37,475716.51,475716.51,-242755.86,66.21,55822.61,11.73,-1381.21,-0.29,"2023-07-28 09:06:02",,Discoverable,,"2023-07-18 10:09:46","Eamonn Mallon (EBM3)","2023-07-28 09:06"

"Genome control by cohesin ligands",,"It has been proposed that DNA folding by ‘loop extrusion’ is a central organising principle of genome conformation. This process involves SMC complexes such as cohesin that by reeling DNA into loops
can bring distant loci into proximity, with important consequences for DNA-based processes. We recently discovered that cohesin is controlled by interaction with ligands such as CTCF. These interactions are essential for control of cohesin function during specific genome transactions such as formation of TADs. CTCF binds cohesin using a specific peptide motif that is present in regulators of replication, transcription, and other fundamental genome functions. We hypothesize that each of these chromosomal regulators represents a ‘cohesin ligand’ that through a universal mechanism directs cohesin to control a different genomic process. We propose an interdisciplinary project involving structural biology, analyses in cells and model organisms, and integrative imaging across scales. Our goals are to understand (1) How cellular ligands control cohesin function. (2) Requirements of chromatid cohesion & DNA looping and (3), to discover new areas of genome biology in which cohesin-mediated genome folding plays critical roles. We will specifically seek a bottom-up understanding of how one general principle of control contributes to different fundamental aspects of genome biology.",581837,,,"Bid Awaiting Response",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",6,2024-03-01,2030-02-28,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"WELLCOME TRUST Wellcome Trust","WELLCOME TRUST Default Scheme","UK Charities (Open Competition & External Peer Review)","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"Wellcome Discovery Awards",,https://wellcome.org/gr...chemes/discovery-awards,,"2023-07-25 17:00",,"2023-07-25 14:40",,"2024-07-24 00:00",,,"Daniel Panne (DP418)",,,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,"Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine,Partner not Listed",,,"LS: Molecular & Cell Biology",,"LS: Molecular & Cell Biology","LS: Molecular & Cell Biology",,"LS: Molecular & Cell Biology",,No,,,,,,"Yusuf Dedat (YD134)",,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2023-07-25 09:34",,,,,,,4091565.40,4091565.40,5373977.12,5373977.12,4091565.40,4091565.40,-1282411.72,76.14,349815.26,8.55,183404.15,4.48,3633226.33,4091565.40,0.00,4091565.40,0.00,4091565.40,3741750.14,1296819.14,1188295.33,4091565.40,0.00,4091565.40,0.00,4091565.40,503892.00,310662.00,3000.00,883338.19,166411.12,230749.20,27838.80,748888.80,0.00,1450674.40,1450674.40,2733086.12,2733086.12,1450674.40,1450674.40,-1282411.72,53.08,153855.26,10.61,-12555.85,-0.87,"2023-07-26 14:38:48",,Discoverable,,"2023-07-11 14:05:00","Daniel Panne (DP418)","2023-07-26 14:38"

"Gender-based violence, youth, and the arts: developing creative methods for GBV prevention in the Anglophone Caribbean",,"The term gender-based violence (GBV) refers to forms of violence – physical or psychological – that are rooted in gender inequality. A 2021 World Health Organisation study presents GBV as a major public health crisis affecting nearly one in three women globally. Data compiled by UN Women and the UNODC indicates that GBV continues to be a critical issue in the Caribbean region. For decades, GBV has been a central concern in Caribbean feminist scholarship and activism, and in recent years Caribbean governments have launched programmes dedicated to combatting gender-based violence. Projects aimed at eliminating violence against women and girls, facilitated by the UN/EU Spotlight Initiative (2020-2023), have generated a renewed focus on this issue across the region. 
This project will address the ongoing problem of persistent high levels of GBV in the region by exploring culturally sensitive strategies for youth-focused GBV prevention using literature and the performing arts. Arts-based methods have been used in GBV research for some time. However, this research has focused primarily on the Global North, and as a result there is a limited evidence base for such methods in other parts of the world. Since GBV has culturally specific dynamics, GBV prevention initiatives need to be culturally relevant. Arts-based approaches to GBV should therefore ideally engage with art forms that speak to and resonate with the communities where the intervention is taking place. With this in mind, our project will develop and evaluate an arts-based methodology that draws upon the Caribbean region’s distinctive literary and performance cultures.
Caribbean literary and oral forms such as poetry, spoken word and community theatre have long been entwined with social and political protest. The link between creative practice and activism remains strong in the contemporary cultural moment: young people across the region are using these creative modes to tackle social justice issues such as gender equality and GBV. We aim in this project to channel the transformative power of these cultural forms through a series of activities that will connect young people with youth leaders, creative practitioners and GBV activists. To achieve this aim, the project has the following objectives:  

-	To co-create a youth-focused and arts-based methodology for GBV prevention that is grounded in and responsive to the social and cultural specifics of GBV in the Caribbean region

-	To facilitate knowledge exchange between researchers, creative practitioners and NGOs about GBV and the arts

-	To build capacity within youth organisations for longer-term, sustainable programmes to prevent GBV through arts-based youth engagement
	
This project will enhance GBV education in the region by (1) training youth leaders in Jamaica and Guyana to facilitate a programme of performing arts workshops focused on GBV prevention, working with 200 young people aged 13-17; (2) curating an open access digital resource  that will showcase creative material from the workshops alongside other project outputs; (3) running a poetry and spoken word competition for young people aged 18-25 across the Anglophone Caribbean where entries will focus on GBV, and publishing an e-anthology containing the shortlisted pieces; (4) presenting an end-of-project policy brief to ministers representing gender affairs in each country. The project will develop a model of youth-led, peer education while raising the profile of the region’s literary and performance cultures in public debate on GBV.",540176,,,"Bid Awaiting Response",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",2,2024-02-01,2026-01-31,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"AHRC Arts & Humanities Research Council","AHRC Default Scheme","Research Councils - AHRC","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"Developing innovative approaches to gender-based violence",,https://www.ukri.org/opportunity/developing-innovative-approaches-to-gender-based-violence/,,"2023-06-27 14:40",400000.00,"2023-06-23 11:20",,"2024-06-22 00:00",,,"Lucy Evans (LAE9)",,,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,"Partner not Listed,University of Bristol","Partner not Listed",,"SS/AR: English",,"SS/AR: English","SS/AR: English",,"SS/AR: English",,,,,,,,"William Hudson (WOH3)",,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2023-06-20 15:21",,,,,,,358226.15,358226.15,403007.47,403007.47,399471.62,399471.62,-44781.32,88.89,238440.95,66.56,199796.56,55.77,312127.51,399471.62,0.00,399471.62,0.00,399471.62,119785.20,119785.20,118883.23,399471.62,0.00,399471.62,0.00,399471.62,107648.00,0.00,0.00,54338.39,38644.39,2916.00,0.00,35639.60,193244.28,144402.67,144402.67,184039.19,184039.19,180503.34,180503.34,-39636.52,78.46,24617.47,17.05,-14026.92,-9.71,"2023-07-26 11:22:33",,Private,,"2023-04-20 14:39:58","Lucy Evans (LAE9)","2023-07-26 11:22"
"Born in Babylon, made in Egypt; modes and mechanisms for transmitting ideas in the Ancient Near East, 3100-539 BCE",,"This project writes a history of the transmission of ideas from the cuneiform world (Mesopotamia and the Levant) to Ancient Egypt, from the rise of the world’s oldest scripts (3100BCE) to the Persian hegemony (marked by the 539BCE fall of Babylon). As new ideas from non-Egyptian cultures transformed Egypt’s social and cultural fabric, the project will revolutionise our understanding of multiculturalism in arguably the world’s oldest polity. The first of its two key research directions asks what ideas were transmitted, with four key categories of idea: artistic, ideological, scholarly, and technological. The second looks at how transmission occurred, assessing four main mechanisms: diplomacy, migration, trade, and warfare. 

Previous scholarship notes an eastern Mediterranean ‘international age’ in the late second millennium BCE, but it has so far mostly focused on the Amarna Letters (14th century BCE), which span only a few decades of a millennia-long multicultural dialogue. Mesopotamian motifs exist in Egyptian art as early as 3100BCE, while Egypt’s ensuing commercial expansion towards Lebanon deepened international contacts. The second millennium BCE saw Egypt often fighting various Levantine peoples, its armies reaching the Euphrates and diplomatic relations extending to lands as 
diverse as Anatolia, Cyprus and Babylon. In various ways, this international outlook lasted until the Persian conquest. This project illuminates which ideas travelled, and how, in this enduring, interlinked world. 

The wide-ranging dataset encompasses both texts and objects, including written mentions of foreign ideas and people in Egyptian and cuneiform sources as well as material culture analysis, like the identification of foreign workmanship on ceramics and stelae. Public engagement will feature throughout, with project updates accessible through a YouTube channel, an online database and an overarching website. There will also be a dedicated ‘early multiculturalism’ resource for schools.",555795,,,"Bid Awaiting Response",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",4,2024-10-01,2028-09-30,,"RF - Research Fellowship",Research,,"UKRI UK Research and Innovation UKRI",,"Research Councils - UKRI","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"FLF round 8",,https://www.ukri.org/opportunity/future-leaders-fellowships-round-8/,,"2023-07-04 16:00",,"2023-07-04 09:50",,"2024-07-03 00:00",,,"Selena Wisnom (LSW14)",,,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,,"Partner not Listed",,"SS/AH: Archaeology & Ancient History",,"SS/AH: Archaeology & Ancient History","SS/AH: Archaeology & Ancient History",,"SS/AH: Archaeology & Ancient History",,,,,,,,"William Hudson (WOH3)",,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2023-07-04 09:17",,,,,,,1935386.05,1935386.05,2613118.84,2613118.84,2453175.06,2453175.06,-677732.79,74.06,602747.21,31.14,602747.21,31.14,1172695.06,2453175.06,0.00,2453175.06,0.00,2453175.06,1332638.84,1332638.84,1172695.06,2453175.06,0.00,2453175.06,0.00,2453175.06,33300.00,0.00,6600.00,145800.00,0.00,145800.00,0.00,1134680.00,0.00,1935386.05,1935386.05,2613118.84,2613118.84,2453175.06,2453175.06,-677732.79,74.06,602747.21,31.14,602747.21,31.14,"2023-07-26 09:51:18",,Private,,"2023-05-22 16:34:19","Selena Wisnom (LSW14)","2023-07-26 09:51"

"Very preterm babies primary care needs (methods call)",,"The incidence of preterm birth in the UK is increasing and more infants, born more prematurely, are surviving to discharge home after specialist neonatal care. After hospital discharge, parents are advised that their GP should be their first port of call if they have any concerns about their baby’s health. However, little is known about healthcare seeking behaviours after neonatal discharge. Previous research has concentrated on readmissions to paediatric intensive care, but use of primary healthcare services, and hospital services other than intensive care, is poorly understood. There is also little contemporary UK evidence on parents’ healthcare needs and resource use after preterm birth. Our proposed study (to be conducted at the University of Nottingham) will address 3 broad aims:
1)	Identify a cohort of children (and their parents) born preterm who are registered in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) and establish the representativeness of this cohort in comparison to all preterm infants discharged home from neonatal care in England and Wales.
2)	Describe ex-preterm children’s medium and longer-term morbidity and healthcare resource use after discharge home from hospital and compare this to a cohort of healthy infants born at term.
3)	Describe morbidity and healthcare resource use in parents of preterm infants and compare this to parents of healthy infants born at term",589181,,,"Bid Submission",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",2,2025-01-01,2026-06-30,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"NIHR National Institute of Health Research","NIHR Default Scheme","UK Central Government","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"RfPB (methodologists call)",,https://www.nihr.ac.uk/funding/rfpb-under-represented-disciplines-and-specialisms-highlight-notice-methodologists/33231,,"2023-09-13 10:30",250000.00,,,,,,"Sarah Seaton (SES26)",,,"Only people involved in this project",,"UNIVERSITY HOSPITALS OF DERBY & BURTON NHS FOUNDATION TRUST,University of Nottingham",Yes,,,,,"LS/HS: Population Health Sciences",,"LS/HS: Population Health Sciences","LS/HS: Population Health Sciences",,"LS/HS: Population Health Sciences",,,,,,,,"Thomas Barson (TB199)",,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2023-07-25 13:03",,,,,,,,8216.69,,10796.52,,10270.87,-2579.82,76.11,8216.69,100,2221.98,27.04,0.00,10270.87,0.00,10270.87,0.00,10270.87,0.00,0.00,0.00,10270.87,0.00,10270.87,0.00,10270.87,0.00,0.00,0.00,6541.47,5994.72,546.75,0.00,4255.05,0.00,8216.69,,10796.52,,10270.87,,-2579.82,76.11,8216.69,100,2221.98,27.04,"2023-07-25 14:26:45",,Discoverable,,"2023-07-25 10:12:56","Sarah Seaton (SES26)","2023-09-13 08:31"

"The Antiplatelet therapy in spontaneous coronary artery dissection Trial (APT-SCAD Trial)",APT-SCAD,"BHF GCRFF Multinational Clinical Trial   -  Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is an increasingly recognized condition where a dissection of the coronary artery by an intramural hematoma results in myocardial ischemia. Choice of treatment for these, mostly female, patients remains challenging since randomized trials in this disease entity are lacking. The mode of antiplatelet treatment (APT - single [SAPT] vs. dual antiplatelet therapy [DAPT]) and length of treatment is an area of controversy. Recent observations even suggest potential adverse effects of DAPT. From a pathophysiological point of view, prolonged bleeding time due to intensive APT could lead to propagation of the intramural hematoma accompanied by an increased rate of non-coronary bleeding. However, some clinical recommendations advocate the use of a more intensive DAPT strategy, which remains the most commonly utilized APT strategy despite the lack of evidence for benefit. We hypothesize that a moderate APT strategy using SAPT for 3 months followed by the cessation of any APT will be superior to an intensive APT regimen using 3 month DAPT followed by 9 months of SAPT on cardiovascular and bleeding events in conservatively managed SCAD patients. This trial will establish evidence for treatment in these patients, aiming to improve outcomes and reduce the global CVD burden.",569485,,,"Bid Awaiting Response",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",8,2024-09-01,2032-02-29,,"RC - Research Clinical Trial",Research,,"BHF British Heart Foundation","BRITISH HEART Default Scheme","UK Charities (Open Competition & External Peer Review)","T3 - 20% VAT on Expenditure - not recoverable,Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"BHF Clinical Study Grant",,https://www.bhf.org.uk/for-professionals/information-for-researchers/what-we-fund/clinical-study,https://www.bhf.org.uk/for-professionals/information-for-researchers/gcrff-multinational-clinical-trials-initiative,"2023-07-05 17:00",,"2023-07-18 08:55",,"2024-07-17 00:00",,,"David Adlam (DA134)",,"Michelle Newton (MCS33)","Only people involved in this project",,"Partner not Listed",Yes,"Imperial College London","London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine",,,"LS: Cardiovascular Sciences",,"LS: Cardiovascular Sciences","LS: Cardiovascular Sciences",,"LS: Cardiovascular Sciences",,Yes,,,,"99 - Not Applicable for Institute reporting","UNITED KINGDOM","Kerry Warner (KW153)",,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,"Full Application",,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Not Applicable for HEBCI","Not applicable for HEBCI",,"2023-06-30 13:19",,,,,,"BHF GCRFF Multinational Clinical Trial GCRFF/23/270127",1116803.03,1116803.03,1481209.92,1481209.92,1116803.03,1116803.03,-364406.89,75.4,0.00,0,-249920.89,-22.38,1116803.03,1116803.03,0.00,1116803.03,0.00,1116803.03,1116803.03,350417.03,350417.03,1116803.03,0.00,1116803.03,0.00,1116803.03,350417.03,0.00,1000.00,279305.89,249920.89,26221.50,3163.50,85101.00,0.00,350417.03,350417.03,714823.92,714823.92,350417.03,350417.03,-364406.89,49.02,0.00,0,-249920.89,-71.32,"2023-07-25 13:30:31",,Discoverable,,"2023-06-19 12:12:19","Michelle Newton (MCS33)","2023-07-25 13:30"

"Autonomous Search And Rescue Intelligent Unmanned System (ASARIUS)",ASARIUS,"This industry-led project will bring together Sky Drones (UK lead), BT (UK), Oblivion Aerial (Switzerland) and University of Leicester together to work on enhancing navigation and control as well as connectivity for beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) operation of drone missions.  University of Leicester will focus on the navigation and control methods and algorithms, including the obstacle avoidance challenges. BT will support the evaluation and development of methods and systems for enhanced connectivity for BVLOS operation.  Autonomous obstacle detection and avoidance will be possible by using  avionics platfroms and further enhancing AI and mission/navigation methods and software from Sky Drones to enhance the provision of services and applications such as aerial photography and search and rescue, which will be the focus of Swiss company Oblivion Aerial.

Drones autonomy and intelligence is a field where Sky Drones (the lead) is one of the leading companies in the UK and globally, having developed the Airlink for a multitude of drone platforms, currently considered to be the most advanced small UAV AI enabled civilian avionics platforms. Airlink stands for Artificial Intelligence & Remote Link. The unit includes a cutting-edge drone autopilot, AI mission computer and a 4G LTE or 5G connectivity unit. Support from BT will be important for the beyond line of sight  4G and 5G connectivity.

There will be opportunities for Sky Drones to evaluate the feasibility of autonomous path planning and following and obstacle avoidance algorithms, which can be done on their Airlink avionics platforms for example, with application to drone based aerial imaging, including search and rescue.",587143,,,"Bid Submission",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",2,2024-01-01,2025-06-30,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"INNOVATE UK Innovate UK","INNOVATE UK Default Scheme","UK Central Government","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"UK – Switzerland Bilateral: Collaborative R&D",,https://apply-for-innovation-funding.service.gov.uk/competition/1518/overview/30ee47a4-f883-4d9e-8370-d644ac621753#summary,,"2023-07-26 11:00",,,,,,,"Nadjim Horri (NMH22)",,,"Only people involved in this project",,"Partner not Listed",Yes,,,"Partner not Listed",,"SE/EN: Aero' & Computational Engineering",,"SE/EN: Aero' & Computational Engineering","SE/EN: Aero' & Computational Engineering",,"SE/EN: Aero' & Computational Engineering",,,,,,,,,,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2023-07-24 12:21",,,,,,"This is an industry-led bid.

"ChroNiC - Unlocking the potential for combined green recovery of Nickel from laterite ores and the permanent sequestration of CO2 and Chromium(VI)",ChroNiC,"Society relies on mining, especially for the critical metals required for clean energy technologies. These technologies will play a vital role in the mitigation of CO2 emissions and achieving global net zero carbon. Despite their international importance, mining and metal extraction still contribute significantly to the release of CO2 and potentially toxic elements and can have a negative impact on the environment and society. Nickel is an essential metal for lithium-ion batteries used in clean energy technologies and electric vehicles, and as a result nickel demand is forecast to double by 2050. However, nickel mining and extraction is associated with the release of hexavalent chromium, a carcinogenic pollutant made famous by the story of Erin Brockovich. Our challenge is therefore to urgently find ways to minimise the release of both hexavalent chromium and CO2 whilst mining and extracting the nickel we require.

Our project ChroNiC (representing chromium, nickel and carbon) brings together experts from across the disciplines of geoscience, sustainable resource extraction, and chemical and process engineering with world leading analytical facilities. We will take a cross-disciplinary approach to tackling environmental challenges associated with the mining of nickel. We aim to integrate our exciting recent research developments in the recovery of nickel using novel, environmentally benign solvents, with simultaneous removal, or sequestration, of both CO2 and hexavalent chromium into solid carbonate minerals so that they are safely stored. ChroNiC will achieve this through four objectives: 1). Utilise natural laboratories in Oman and the Philippines that offer unique opportunities to study how these pollutants have been naturally locked-up over geological time. 2). This knowledge will then be transferred into the laboratory, where we will accelerate the natural processes of mineral dissolution and crystallisation, ultimately aiming at the formation of chromium-bearing carbonate minerals, whilst simultaneously extracting the nickel in a low energy process. The successful delivery of ChroNiC will rely on the formation of carbonate minerals that are stable at the Earth surface and will not release the contaminants back to the biosphere. 3). We will thus, invest significant experimental and analytical effort to understand the underlying mechanisms behind carbonate formation from our environment-friendly solvents, and iteratively tailor the process to produce the best materials. 4). Finally, we will use experimental techniques to analyse and optimise the stability of these minerals to ensure that they will provide long-term sequestration of carbonate and chromium.

This is novel, cutting-edge, and adventurous science that will be underpinned by high resolution micro- and nano-scale data obtained from a globally unique experimental setup at the Diamond Synchrotron Light Source, developed by ChroNiC team members at the University of Leeds.  Collectively, we will provide whole system understanding of the potential for simultaneous recovery of nickel together with the sequestration of CO2 and hexavalent chromium, creating the foundations for a process that can be scaled up to industrial applications. ChroNiC will offer a transformative step-change in the science underpinning sustainable, carbon- and hexavalent chromium-neutral processing of nickel ores globally, thus leading to a cleaner safer future for society.",572637,,,"Bid Awaiting Response",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",3,2024-04-01,2027-03-31,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"NERC NERC (Nat.

"Aiden Smith NIHR Doctoral Research Fellowship Application","AJS DRF","Aims of the Research: 

This project is looking at how information is used to predict how individuals may develop a given disease. These are known as ""clinical prediction models"" (CPMs). The objectives of the project are: 

O1. To see how poor data quality affects CPMs and to develop methods to address this. 

O2. To assess if CPMs used to inform clinical decisions are accurate and they work for everyone, including minority groups. 

O3. To see how disease risk using CPMs is affected if the person also has other health conditions – as these can affect both disease risk and survival.  

O4. To improve how personalized disease risk is communicated. An online webtool will be developed to enable the public to enter their own information and calculate their risk of developing bowel cancer, with a view to increasing uptake of the bowel cancer screening program. 

Background: 

CPMs are used by health professionals, particularly clinicians, to estimate the chance of a patient developing a given health problem. They help clinicians to decide on care/treatment options and resources needed for a given patient. It is important that estimates from CPMs are accurate and unbiased because: 

Inaccurate estimates can lead to incorrect treatment decisions, potentially causing harm to the patient. 

Valuable healthcare resources can be targeted where they are needed most. 

Unbiased estimates ensure fairness in healthcare. CPMs should not discriminate against certain groups, such as by ethnicity or socioeconomic groups.  

There are currently no clear guidelines for addressing data quality issues when developing CPMs such as missing data and they are not always tested to see if they work on different groups of individuals – such as different ethnic groups. This project will help to develop methods that will ensure accurate model estimates. It will also promote these methods widely; such that other researchers can produce high quality research to improve clinical practice.   

Methods: 

To achieve these objectives: 

M1. I will search published literature to identify current methods that address data quality issues. I will conduct a simulation study to identify the impact of different proportions of missing data on the model estimates.  

M2. I will develop methods to handle scenarios where missing data is different between the data the models are developed on and the data which the models are validated on. This will improve the use of the CPM for different populations or countries. 

M3.  I will investigate how pre-existing health conditions impact upon CPM estimates by defining an optimal lookback window for comorbidity inclusion, and whether sicker patients with more up to date information influence model outcomes.  

M4. Following the development of the CPM, I will quantify the impact that failing to consider varying mortality rates over time has on survival predictions.  

M5. I will develop a user-friendly webtool to provide personalized risk estimates for bowel cancer, and public facing materials to encourage uptake of bowel cancer screening in high-risk patient groups. 

Patient and Public Involvement (PPI): 

I have identified a PPI lead for the PPI advisory panel who has been involved in the development of this project and reviewing of this Plain English Summary. Existing PPI networks will help to recruit PPI panel members who will be utilized to ensure patient-focused outcomes throughout the project. The panels' experiences as patients and service users will continue to shape the direction of the project throughout. 

Dissemination: 

I will present my findings at international conferences and by publishing them in scientific journals. I will host a workshop upon completion of the project for researchers, clinicians and patients to attend. I also intend to create online resources that will be made available through social media networks.",559985,,,"Bid Awaiting Response",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",3,2024-06-01,2027-05-31,,"RF - Research Fellowship",Research,,"NIHR National Institute of Health Research","NIHR Default Scheme","UK Central Government","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"NIHR Doctoral Research Fellowship Round 10",,https://www.nihr.ac.uk/funding/nihr-doctoral-fellowship-round-10/33109,,"2023-07-27 13:00",,"2023-07-19 14:44",,"2024-07-18 00:00",,,"Aiden Smith (AJS134)",,,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,,,,"LS/HS: Population Health Sciences",,"LS/HS: Population Health Sciences","LS/HS: Population Health Sciences",,"LS/HS: Population Health Sciences",,,,,,,,"Thomas Barson (TB199)",,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2023-07-17 11:47",,,,,,,335318.51,335318.51,434249.68,434249.68,414578.38,414578.38,-98931.17,77.22,93140.83,27.78,93140.83,27.78,222506.38,414578.38,0.00,414578.38,0.00,414578.38,242177.68,242177.68,222506.38,414578.38,0.00,414578.38,0.00,414578.38,62351.63,33399.60,1507.00,21870.00,0.00,21870.00,0.00,170202.00,0.00,335318.51,335318.51,434249.68,434249.68,414578.38,414578.38,-98931.17,77.22,93140.83,27.78,93140.83,27.78,"2023-07-19 14:44:47",,Private,,"2023-05-30 10:53:31","Aiden Smith (AJS134)","2023-08-09 09:45"
"Are early life environments effects on ageing mediated by the epigenetic clock?",,"This project will help understand the proximate causes of life history evolution by establishing the effect of larval diapause on insect epigenetic ageing. This extends our discovery of epigenetics’s role in several insect life history traits (1). Why individuals and species age so differently is one of the biggest unanswered questions in evolutionary biology (2).
Environments can be variable and organisms can be selected to sense the state of their environ- ment early in life and to adaptively adjust their life history in response to these changes (3). The ability of one genotype to produce different life-histories depending on the environment is known as a life-history polyphenism (3). We ask could epigenetics and specifially the epigenetic clock be a proximate mechanism of these life-history polyphenisms.
An epigenetic clock is a biochemical test based on measuring the accumulation of chemical marks (DNA methylation) to DNA molecules (4). There is evidence epigenetic age mirrors true biological age and its associated morbidity and mortality better than chronological age (5). The rate at which an epigenetic clock ticks is strongly affected by the environment. This seems especially true in the early stages of life (6). This gives rise to the idea that an epigenetic clock can be developmentally tuned as part of an adaptive response to environmental variables experienced during development (6).
Aging is a complex process influenced by many environmental and genetic components. The effects of these components influence each other making them difficult to investigate, especially in complex mammalian models. Therefore, a large body of ageing research is based on simple model invertebrate organisms (7, 8). Advantages include easy and cheap to keep in a laboratory, short lifespan, genetic and molecular tools available, and a sequenced genome. However, the current invertebrate models of ageing (Drosophila (9) and C. elegans (10)) do not possess detectable DNA methylation, reducing their generality.
The jewel wasp, Nasonia vitripennis, an emerging model system (11) has a functional methylation system (12) making it an ideal system to investigate the epigenetics of ageing. We therefore mea- sured chronological ageing and changes in the epigenome using whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) in order to discover if Nasonia vitripennis possessed an epigenetic clock. The epigenetic age of each replicate is the weighted average of each genes’ methylation state. This epigenetic age does indeed correlate with chronological age (13). This is similar to results found in many vertebrates (6). However, this is the first time an epigenetic clock has been discovered in a tractable insect model.
An example of a life-history polyphenism in Nasonia is larval diapause, an overwintering stage where development is arrested and adult lifespan is increased (14). DNA methylation is involved in Nasonia diapause (15). Using published RNA-seq datasets (16), we have found an increase in the expression of DMNT1a (the enzyme responsible for DNA methylation maintenance) and a decrease in TET (the enzyme that removes methylation) in diapaused versus non-diapaused larvae. This suggests a maintenance of DNA methylation during diapause.",575056,,,"Bid Awaiting Response",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",3,2024-05-01,2027-04-30,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"NERC NERC (Nat.

"An implementation study to promote antimicrobial stewardship programs in oncology settings",,"Aims:
Antibacterial resistance (ABR) is a threat to cancer therapy success. Inappropriate antibiotic use is a major
risk factor for ABR and a common form of low-value healthcare in oncology settings. Though antimicrobial
stewardship (AMS) programs optimize antibiotic use, curb ABR and decrease healthcare costs, cancer
patients are often excluded. Hence, this project aims to describe, compare, and explain variations in AMS
program implementation in oncology settings and create an organizational toolkit to advance AMS program
implementation
Research methods
This is a multi-stage Type II Hybrid Implementation-Clinical effectiveness study using quantitative and
qualitative methods.
• Identify the evidence-practice gap
Patterns and trends of antibiotic use and ABR: Quarterly data on antibiotic use and ABR from oncology
departments at general hospitals and cancer hospitals covered by the Center for Antibacterial Surveillance
(CAS) and China Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (CARSS) (2013-2023) will be collected.
Antibiotic use and ABR will be described using defined daily doses per 100 patient-days and resistant
proportion, respectively. Trends will be assessed by linear regression.
AMS program implementation: A questionnaire will be designed based on a literature review and Delphi
expert consultations. Oncology departments at general hospitals and cancer hospitals in CAS and/or
CARSS will be surveyed.
• Excavate barriers and facilitators
Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) will be used to develop a semi-structure
interview guide to identify barriers and facilitators. Deductive and inductive content analyses will be
conducted on interview data. Guided by Normalization Process Theory, nominal group technique will be
conducted through a meeting to identify the seven most critical determinants for AMS program
implementation.
• Establish an organizational toolkit and verify the effectiveness
A focus group discussion will be organized to create the toolkit based on Capability-Opportunity-
Motivation Behavior model and CFIR-ERIC (Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change)
Implementation Strategy Matching Tool. A quais-experimental multicenter study will be conducted over
24 months with an intervention period of 12 months. The RE-AIM Framework will guide the evaluation,
with interrupted time-series regression analysis used for comparison before and after the intervention.
Expected outcomes:
This study is expected to generate high-quality evidence to advance AMS program implementation in oncology
settings by leveraging implementation science. At least three high-impact papers and a report providing
evidence-based recommendations for policy making are expected.
Potential implications:
This project could accelerate optimal AMS program implementation in oncology settings, improve appropriate
antibiotic use in cancer patients, and promote the achievement of the goal of Global Action Plan on ABR.",585734,,,"Bid Development",,Pending,"Guiqing Lily Yao (GY38),Pre-award Admin",3,2024-01-01,2026-12-31,,"RF - Research Fellowship",Research,,"Funder not listed - Commercial","Funder not listed - Commercial Default Scheme","EU Industry, Commerce & Public Corporations","Y5 Income - Services to EU - Zero Rate",,,"China Medical Board 2023 Open Competition Grants Program Call for Applications",,,,"2023-07-31 12:00",,,,,,,"Guiqing Lily Yao (GY38)",,,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,,,,"LS: Cardiovascular Sciences",,"LS: Cardiovascular Sciences","LS: Cardiovascular Sciences",,"LS: Cardiovascular Sciences",,,,,,"99 - Not Applicable for Institute reporting",,"William Hudson (WOH3)",,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"the 13th annual round of the CMB-OC program, with this year’s

"Understanding how Integrated Care Boards implement patient choice and monitor inequalities in elective treatment in order to improve patient utilisation and access equality",,"The Health and Care Act 2022 brought about some fundamental changes to how the NHS is organised in England. The 106 Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) were dissolved in July 2022 and replaced with 42 Integrated Care Systems comprised of Integrated Care Boards (ICBs) and Integrated Care Partnerships. Since July 2022, ICBs have had the statutory responsibility to plan and fund most NHS services in the area covered by the ICS. ICBs have statutory duties under the 2022 Act to “act with a view to enabling patients to make choices with respect to aspects of health services provided to them” and to “reduce inequalities between persons with respect to their ability to access health services”. 

Since 2002 in England, patient choice has been inextricably linked to market reforms with a large increase in the role of the private sector to deliver NHS funded care. Patient choice of provider combined with payment by results and practice-based commissioning has created a market driven competitive environment in the NHS with choice linked to encouraging competition between providers. Research by members of this team has found that waiting times for those living in the most deprived areas of England improved relative to patients in the least deprived areas between 1997 and 2002 but then worsened thereafter.

Scotland however had the opposite experience with worsening inequality to the detriment of patients in the most deprived areas prior to 2002 but a decrease in levels of inequality between 2002 and 2010. The obvious difference between the two countries was the way they implemented competition and provider choice since 2002 and the way they used the private sector to provide NHS funded treatment. Patient choice can exist independently of provider competition and the operationalising of patient choice of provider was very different in England than in Scotland. Scotland has had a much more limited form of patient choice with no internal market or national system to facilitate choice.

This research will investigate how ICBs are planning to meet their duties under the Health and Care Act 2022 with regards to patient choice and equity of access.  A mixed-method study design will be employed including analysing routinely available data, surveying ICBs and conducting qualitative research among key stakeholders. Elective primary hip and knee replacement will be used to analyse inequality.

"Creative collaborations to investigate and address health disparities in Leicester",,"Leicester is the country’s most diverse city and one of the first to have minority majorities. The Centre for Ethnic Health Research (CEHR) and Leicester Diabetes Centre (LDC) are instrumental in highlighting ethnic health disparities in the city and have a strong record of co-creating initiatives to reduce health inequalities, engaging underserved communities using innovative methods that harness social capital.  The University of Leicester’s Heritage Hub is a pioneering initiative, working with civic partners and communities to facilitate cross-disciplinary and cross-sector collaborations, investigating and reducing barriers to participation and ensuring people’s heritage is recognised and celebrated.
This project brings together researchers from the Heritage Hub, CEHR and LDC to form a multi-disciplinary team of academics working across health, social sciences, humanities, arts and environmental sciences.  The team will work directly and equitably with underserved community members, community leaders, public health and social care providers, teams managing community assets, public and third-sector providers of diverse arts, culture and heritage programmes across the city as well as the NHS integrated care board. 
The project encompasses over 30 public sector community-based facilities including faith centres, museums and galleries, green spaces, and university, NHS and community venues including local pharmacies. It will audit and evaluate collective infrastructure, programmes and expertise, mapping the current care systems and pathways, and investigating the barriers and facilitators to engagement with community assets and community health and wellbeing initiatives. It will develop integrated, strategic and replicable approaches to understanding complex intersecting inequalities and proactively and creatively address these through collaborative working.",565239,,,"Bid Awaiting Response",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",3,2024-02-01,2027-01-31,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"AHRC Arts & Humanities Research Council","AHRC Default Scheme","Research Councils - AHRC","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"Collaborative community research to tackle health inequalities",,https://www.ukri.org/opportunity/collaborative-community-research-to-tackle-health-inequalities/,,"2023-07-11 17:05",2500000.00,"2023-07-12 11:15",,"2024-07-11 00:00",,,"Sarah Scott (SAS11)","John Maltby (JM148),Gregory Maniatopoulos (GM369),Gemma Hughes (GH218),Kamlesh Khunti (KK22),Martin Phillips (MPP2),Nuala Morse (NMM15)","Andrew Morden (AWM22),Marie Adams (MFS7)","People involved in this project and ...","Andrew Morden (AWM22),Marie Adams (MFS7)",,Yes,"Leicester City Council","Partner not Listed",,,"SS/AH: Archaeology & AH (Classics)","Business,LS/HS: Diabetes,LS: Psychology,SE/GE: Human Geography,SS/MS: Museum Studies","Business,LS/HS: Diabetes,LS: Psychology,SE/GE: Human Geography,SS/AH: Archaeology & AH (Classics),SS/MS: Museum Studies","SS/AH: Archaeology & AH (Classics)","LS/HS: Diabetes,LS: Psychology,SE/GE: Human Geography,SS/BU: Work, Emp, M'ment & Org, Dept,SS/MS: Museum Studies","LS/HS: Diabetes,LS: Psychology,SE/GE: Human Geography,SS/AH: Archaeology & AH (Classics),SS/BU: Work, Emp, M'ment & Org, Dept,SS/MS: Museum Studies",,,,,,,,"William Hudson (WOH3)",,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2023-07-12 10:35",,,,,,,1833543.32,1833543.32,2365325.65,2365325.65,2290276.33,2290276.33,-531782.33,77.52,490517.96,26.75,185231.42,10.1,1272183.54,2290276.33,0.00,2290276.33,0.00,2290276.33,1343025.35,895266.07,824424.26,2290276.33,0.00,2290276.33,0.00,2290276.33,110912.00,0.00,0.00,393467.96,305286.54,86916.02,1265.40,628832.34,0.00,1474013.64,1474013.64,1917566.37,1917566.37,1842517.05,1842517.05,-443552.73,76.87,578747.56,39.26,273461.02,18.55,"2023-07-12 11:16:03",,Discoverable,,"2023-06-08 16:56:50","Sarah Scott (SAS11)","2023-08-09 10:39"

Insects have evolved a variety of unique ear types at least 19 separate times. Firstly, we wish to understand if insects solved the problem of sensitive hearing in the same or different ways. Insects’ ears evolved from “proprioceptive” organs that detect leg joint angles and are essential for locomotion. Secondly, we wish to understand the specialisations of the proprioceptive organs as they evolved into dedicated auditory organs.

"Model Transformation Language Tutorial(s)",MTL-Tutorials,"Model transformation languages (MTLs) are a crucial aspect of Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) and hold great significance in the broader field of software engineering. MTLs enable the systematic manipulation and conversion of models, which are representations of the system's architecture, behavior, and requirements. In essence, they serve as a bridge between different models, facilitating seamless integration and providing a foundation for model-based development.

In the context of MDE, model transformations play a vital role in generating code, refining models, synchronizing different models, and performing validation and verification tasks. Consequently, MTLs are indispensable for leveraging the full potential of MDE practices, which ultimately contribute to reduced development costs, increased productivity, and enhanced software quality.

However, despite their importance, MTLs like YAMTL and ETL often suffer from a lack of comprehensive documentation. Insufficient learning resources can hinder the adoption of MTLs and limit their effectiveness in real-world software engineering projects. To address this issue, it is essential to improve learning resources and develop comprehensive, accessible materials that demonstrate the power and versatility of these languages.

By preparing educational resources for YAMTL and ETL, we will support a growing platform at KCL dedicated to showcasing these tools. The project's objectives include:

Learning YAMTL and ETL: Although the documentation for these research MTLs varies from scarce to moderately available, it is crucial to become proficient in them to develop high-quality educational resources.
Developing resources for three levels of transformation complexity: To cater to a broad audience, we will create resources for an introductory example, an example showcasing MTL features, and a real-world example with higher complexity.
Creating a static web page: Using a static web generator, we will build a well-organized and easily accessible documentation page that offers a user-friendly experience.
Organizing resources for integration with the education platform: To ensure seamless integration with the KCL platform, the resources will be structured in a way that enables easy access and incorporation into the platform.
Over the course of 10 weeks (likely to be after the exams in May), this full-time project will not only improve the visibility and adoption of YAMTL and ETL but also empower software engineers and students to leverage these powerful MTLs more effectively. By investing in better learning resources, we can unlock the full potential of MDE and make a meaningful impact on the software engineering landscape.

This is a collaboration with colleagues from the University of York and the University of Ulm to develop open-source learning resources on MDE technologies. The project aims to create a repository of learning materials focused on model transformations, which will be used to contribute to an education platform on MDE being developed at KCL in collaboration with Leicester and York. We plan to use YAMTL, a tool developed at Leicester that is attracting international attention in the MDE community, as well as other tools developed at York.

My colleagues and I are interested in this project for the following reasons:

Firstly, by developing open-source learning resources focused on model transformations in MDE, this collaboration can contribute to the wider dissemination of knowledge in this field. This may lead to increased use of MDE technologies, including those developed at Leicester, by industry and academia, improving the efficiency and effectiveness of software development. This could lead to future collaborations with industry partners, resulting in further research impact.
Secondly, disseminating these resources via the EPSRC network MDENet has the potential to enhance the visibility of Leicester and its MDE technologies, both in the UK and internationally. This could lead to further collaborations with other universities and industry partners, resulting in new research projects and the development of new MDE technologies.
These collaborations could result in increased citation rates of Leicester's research publications, which may improve the institution's research ranking and funding opportunities. The open-source nature of the learning resources also means that they can be used and adapted by other researchers, potentially leading to new publications and collaborations.

"Early  treatment  of  Atrial  fibrillation  for  Stroke  prevention Trial in acute STROKE (EAST-STROKE",EAST-STROKE,"EAST-STROKE is an investigator-initiated, prospective, randomized, open, blinded endpoint assessment (PROBE)interventional multicentre trial to test whether rhythm control treatment effectively prevents recurrent stroke and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with a recent (<4 weeks) ischemic stroke. This proposal tackles three highly prevalent conditions related to circulatory health: atrial fibrillation (AF), stroke, and cardiovascular disease (e.g., myocardial infarction, heart failure), and aligns with CIHR-ICRH goals.  Compared to other stroke etiologies, AF-related strokes are among the most severe, are associated with large-volume brain infarcts, generate severe disability, and have higher mortality, and short- and long-term recurrence rates. The annual cost of stroke is $ 3.6 billion in Canada.14 AF-related strokes generate 50%higher direct acute care costs than non-AF-related strokes. One in every nine first-ever ischemic stroke patients without known cardiovascular comorbidities experience a MACE in the first year post-stroke.  AF is a strong and consistent marker of MACE risk. Furthermore, ischemic stroke patients with pre-existing AF have a particularly high risk of experiencing other cardiovascular complications. Total yearly costs of patients who experience an incident MACE are threefold higher than patients who do not have cardiovascular complications. Stroke and MACE in AF patients are a significant clinical problem that is only partly solved with anticoagulation. Given the suboptimal recurrent stroke and MACE prevention performance of oral anticoagulants in stroke patients, new strategies are needed. Based on the results of the EAST-AFNET 4 trial in patients with AF (Kirchhof, N Engl J Med 2020; 383:1305-1316)rhythm control therapy is a promising and novel approach that can potentially reduce stroke recurrence and MACE in stroke patients. Rhythm control therapy is a current standard of care for patients with AF but has not yet been adopted for stroke patients because of the lack of specific evidence for this population. If the results of EAST-STROKE show that rhythm control therapy can prevent recurrent stroke and MACE, millions of patients with AF and stroke worldwide will have a new therapeutic option to reduce the residual risk of major cardiovascular events.",553326,,,"Bid Awaiting Response",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",6,2024-07-01,2029-12-31,,"RC - Research Clinical Trial",Research,,"BHF British Heart Foundation","BRITISH HEART Default Scheme","UK Charities (Open Competition & External Peer Review)","T3 - 20% VAT on Expenditure - not recoverable,Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"Clinical Study Grant",,https://www.bhf.org.uk/for-professionals/information-for-researchers/what-we-fund/clinical-study,https://www.bhf.org.uk/for-professionals/information-for-researchers/gcrff-multinational-clinical-trials-initiative,"2023-07-05 17:00",,"2023-07-04 16:30",,"2024-07-03 00:00",,,"G.

All therapies and procedures (first-line AF ablation or usual care) are approved and will be applied in their clinical indications. EASThigh-AFNET 11 will be conducted in several countries in Europe, Canada and Australia. The study is event-driven with a planned number of randomised and treated patients of n=2318 and a fixed number of primary endpoint events (n=527) to be observed for testing superiority. Study patients will be randomized to one of two parallel therapy strategy in a 1:1 ratio, designated as “Early AF Ablation” and “Usual Care” group. Randomisation will be done as stratified per study site in blocks of variable size to minimise selection bias. We expect a recruitment phase of 36 months and a median follow-up period of 44 months.

"Sophie Frost FLF - Hidden Digital Labour?    Exploring the role and impact of technology on the future of cultural work",,"Digital labour is an underexplored phenomenon across the non-profit arts and cultural sectors both in the UK and internationally, with little attention placed on how emerging practices of digital labour are impacting lived experiences of cultural work, nor how they are irreversibly changing future cultural employment. Further, there is little known about the distinctive nature of digital labour in different artform contexts. 

Over 7 years, this project presents a multi-layered research plan, combining a programme of independent research in diverse cultural environments, innovative academic collaboration, the forging of a new, public-facing network of critical thinkers from different sectors, partnership working with the USA, and planned development opportunities. It seeks to position the researcher as an established leader on sustainable, equitable, and empathetic digital labour practices in our national and international cultural sectors. 

Embedded within the Institute for Digital Culture at the University of Leicester (UK) and jointly mentored by two leading academics from the fields of Digital Heritage and Employment Studies, this project proposes to establish a novel set of research partnerships to provide a richer perspective on the phenomenon in question.",562057,,,"Bid Awaiting Response",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",4,2024-11-01,2028-10-31,,"RF - Research Fellowship",Research,,"MRC MRC","MRC Default Scheme","Research Councils - MRC","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"Future Leaders Fellowship - Round 8",,https://www.ukri.org/opportunity/future-leaders-fellowships-round-8/,,"2023-07-04 16:00",2000000.00,"2023-07-04 11:09",,"2024-07-03 00:00",,,"Ross Parry (RDP5)",,"Marie Adams (MFS7)","Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,,"Partner not Listed",,"SS/MS: Museum Studies",,"SS/MS: Museum Studies","SS/MS: Museum Studies",,"SS/MS: Museum Studies",,,,,,"99 - Not Applicable for Institute reporting",,"Sara Mounteney (SLM81)",,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2023-06-29 14:15",,,,,,"The Fellow and Applicant is Dr Sophie Frost - Honorary Research Fellow in the Institute for Digital Culture.",1055912.06,1055912.06,1427907.83,1427907.83,1353832.95,1353832.95,-371995.77,73.95,153001.03,14.49,153001.03,14.49,828836.15,1353832.95,0.00,1353832.95,0.00,1353832.95,902911.03,902911.03,828836.15,1353832.95,0.00,1353832.95,0.00,1353832.95,327561.80,0.00,0.00,59778.00,0.00,59778.00,0.00,465218.80,0.00,1055912.06,1055912.06,1427907.83,1427907.83,1353832.95,1353832.95,-371995.77,73.95,153001.03,14.49,153001.03,14.49,"2023-07-04 11:09:41",,Discoverable,,"2023-06-05 10:49:05","Ross Parry (RDP5)","2023-07-04 11:34"

"Mapping ancient Egypt: the relationship between Egyptology and cartography",,"My project will provide the first analysis of the relationship between the disciplinary traditions of Egyptology and cartography, 1740-1939: from topographical antiquarianism to excavation. Currently, maps produced by Egyptologists are viewed simply as straightforward reflections of regions at a particular time, and are virtually never contextualised. Recent work on visual culture has shown that maps were often manipulated for political purposes, notably for imperial ambitions. My project will show how western knowledge production in proto-colonial and colonial settings was not neutral and demonstrated similar techniques of selectivity, even whilst it was posited as an objective method for catalysing disciplinary formation",477614,RA15W477614,,"Project Live",Locked,Successful,"Post-award Admin,Pre-award Admin,Rosemary Sweet (RHS4)",3,2023-09-01,2026-08-31,,"RF - Research Fellowship",Research,,"THE LEVERHULME TRUST The Leverhulme Trust","THE LEVERHULME TRUST Default Scheme","UK Charities (Open Competition & External Peer Review)","T3 - 20% VAT on Expenditure - not recoverable,Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"Leverhulme early career fellowships",,https://www.leverhulme.ac.uk/early-career-fellowships,,"2023-02-23 16:00",,"2023-02-20 17:20",,"2024-02-20 00:00",2023-05-30,,"Rosemary Sweet (RHS4)",,,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,,,,"SS/HP: History",,"SS/HP: History","SS/HP: History",,"SS/HP: History",,,,,,"99 - Not Applicable for Institute reporting",,,"David Long (DAL11)","Post-award Admin (Project Setup)","Post-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Art & design",ECF-2023-260,"10 - Automatic payment by Funder - Actual Costs",,"Not Applicable for HEBCI","Not applicable for HEBCI",,"2023-02-22 05:30",,,,,,"Match funded by College and Senate",91317.28,94660.00,370235.81,365275.68,165974.55,94660.00,-270615.68,25.91,-78543.68,-82.97,-78543.68,-82.97,94660.00,94660.00,0.00,94660.00,0.00,94660.00,173203.68,173203.68,94660.00,94660.00,0.00,94660.00,0.00,94660.00,16660.00,60.00,0.00,21870.00,0.00,21870.00,0.00,170202.00,0.00,94660.00,91317.28,365275.68,370235.81,94660.00,165974.55,-270615.68,25.91,-78543.68,-82.97,-78543.68,-82.97,"2023-07-03 17:40:18",,Discoverable,,"2023-01-31 16:08:00","Rosemary Sweet (RHS4)","2023-07-03 17:40"

methodologies from demography and identity studies to deepen and improve our understanding of societies along
the Empire’s northernmost frontier. Critical aspects of the now-available information, namely, the ages of corpses
in cemeteries, their delineation within that space, and the commemoration of age in other, related contexts, can
show how societies reacted to long-term occupation, and shed innovative new light on group agency and the

"Experimental Tests of Rational Decision Making",,"Rational decision making under risk/uncertainty and over time is central to economic analysis, and it is natural that experimentalists should want to test both (older) mainstream and (newer) behavioural models of choice within these contexts. Generally speaking, many experiments to-date have collected a relatively small number of decisions from each subject, with these problems somewhat narrowly tailored to refute particular theories (or components of those theories). The emphasis in our research is to present subjects with problems that are representative (in a statistical and economic sense) in order to provide a better positive account of preferences. In order to do this, we develop tests which are (a) comprehensive (in the sense that they apply to each model taken as a whole) and (b) nonparametric (in the sense that they avoid making auxiliary functional form assumptions). We then apply our tests to rich individual-level data which are amenable to statistical analysis.",556154,RS10W556154,,"Project Live",Locked,Successful,"Matthew Polisson (MRP38),Post-award Admin,Pre-award Admin",1,2023-06-01,2024-05-31,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"BRITISH ACADEMY The British Academy","BA/Leverhulme Small Research Grants","Research Councils (BEIS) - Roy Society and Brit Academy","T3 - 20% VAT on Expenditure - not recoverable,Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"British Academy/Leverhulme Small Research Grants",,,,,,"2021-06-01 16:05",,"2024-06-25 00:00",2021-06-01,,"Matthew Polisson (MRP38)",,,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,,,,"SS/BU: Acc'ing, Ec'mics & Finance, Dept",,"SS/BU: Acc'ing, Ec'mics & Finance, Dept","SS/BU: Acc'ing, Ec'mics & Finance, Dept",,"SS/BU: Acc'ing, Ec'mics & Finance, Dept",,,,,,"99 - Not Applicable for Institute reporting",,"Helena Wright (HW194)","Daksha Patel (DP230)","Post-award Admin (Project Setup)","Post-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,Yes,,"University of Bristol",,,,,"Business & management studies",SRG21\211614,"10 - Automatic payment by Funder - Actual Costs",,"Not Applicable for HEBCI","Not applicable for HEBCI",,"2023-06-21 15:34",,,,,,"This is a grant transfer request for an unspent (due to COVID-19) BA small grant from Bristol University.

"DevelopmEnt of Seaweed-based biofuels To aId eNergy trAnsiTION",DESTINATION,"DESTINATION will be centred around a 500-square meter test farm, located in the Freeport of Saldanha, South Africa, in which pond-based farming of salt water seaweed is combined with anaerobic digestion, optimised for circularity of the separate processes to minimise process energy demand and maximise nutrient recovery. This programme will be supported by research and development in the UK and Cape Town, by improving components of the test farm and evaluating lifecycles as global potential.

The operation of the test farm itself will directly create 3 permanent jobs in a vulnerable community of colour, with the job specs being designed to ascertain equitable opportunity, for women, youth and people caring for others. 

A successful conclusion of the project will unlock investment into a full scale application of the project, in the West Coast of South Africa, which suffers from severe unemployment in disenfranchised fishing communities of colour, creating in excess of 1000 jobs per full scale plant.

Whilst algae to fuel is being tried in many variations, this is the only project we identified were seaweed is farmed to produce fuels, via anaerobic digestion in a circular fashion, rather than trying to extract lipids from micro algae or anaerobic digestion of beach cast seaweed, both of which struggling to reach profitability.

At 'DESTINATION' shore based raceway ponds – or paddlewheel ponds- are used to farm ulva armoricana (sea lettuce) as feedstock for a continuous mixing anaerobic digester, producing biogas. Whilst the amounts of biogas that DESTINATION will produce will be small, they will serve to analyse the gas for composition and its potential to be split into CH4 and CO2, whereas the CH4 will be liquefied and used as shipping fuel and the CO2 will be used in the food and beverage industry at first and eventually enable the emerging green hydrogen industry to lengthen the value chain, by synthesising GH2 with the CO2 in a Fisher-Tropsch to produce e-enhanced biomehtanol or sustainable aviation fuels.",568919,,,"Bid Awaiting Response",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",2,2024-04-01,2026-03-31,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"INNOVATE UK Innovate UK","INNOVATE UK Default Scheme","UK Central Government","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"Energy Catalyst Round 10: Mid Stage",,https://apply-for-innovation-funding.service.gov.uk/competition/1460/overview/36602eaa-b37b-4ac3-90fe-4e2a33bb4768,,"2023-06-28 12:00",1500000.00,"2023-06-28 14:34",,"2024-06-27 00:00",,,"Shiladitya Paul (SP660)","Hong Dong (HD38),Bo Tian (BT156)","Kranthi Maniam (KM508),Vikas Kumar (VK115)","Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,,,,"SE/EN: TWI Innovation Centre",,"SE/EN: TWI Innovation Centre","SE/EN: TWI Innovation Centre",,"SE/EN: TWI Innovation Centre",,,,,,"99 - Not Applicable for Institute reporting","SOUTH AFRICA","Anna Kardas (AM565)",,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,"Full Application",,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2023-06-22 10:27",,,,,,"TECHNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS LTD.

"Design and test of galactose analogues to treat pneumococcal infections",,"Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus, Spn) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, responsible for an estimated with estimations of ~1.2 million deaths and ~197 million episodes of pneumococcal pneumonia annually, and one of the commonest agents of meningitis. The critical need to develop anti-Spn therapies is complicated by two key factors. First, the emergence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) strains, resulting in Spn’s inclusion on the WHO priority pathogens list for R&D of new antibiotics. Second, in chronic infections, Spn adopts a biofilm mode of growth that is recalcitrant to antibiotics and can exhibit minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICS) 10-100 fold higher than the same strain in planktonic mode of growth. Existing antibiotics impede a narrow set of cellular processes: DNA replication, protein synthesis, and cell wall biosynthesis. With the global increase in drug resistance, there is an enormous interest in the investigation of alternate essential cellular processes, including bacterial central metabolic pathways, as a future drug target.
The development of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has made treatment of these infections increasingly difficult, resulting in the inclusion of pneumococcus on the WHO priority pathogens list for R&D of new antibiotics. Furthermore, despite the introduction of vaccines there is continued circulation of vaccine serotypes and increased invasive disease caused by non-vaccine serotypes.  There is therefore an urgent need for the development of new treatments for pneumococcal disease and to reduce the development of AMR . Research carried out by our groups has shown that galactose, the predominant carbohydrate in the respiratory tract, is essential for pneumococcal survival in host and regulation of its virulence. We also show that galactose metabolism can be selectively targeted. Here we propose to develop antiinfectives Targeting targeting pneumococcal galactose metabolism therefore represents an attractive target for the development of novel therapeutics, and an innovative strategy for targeting bacterial infection.",570925,,,"Bid Submission",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",2,2024-05-01,2026-04-30,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"EPSRC EPSRC ENG.& PHYS.SCIENCES R C",,"Research Councils - EPSRC","T3 - 20% VAT on Expenditure - not recoverable,Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"EPSRC working with overseas scientists, May 2023: responsive mode",,"   https://www.ukri.org/opportunity/epsrc-responsive-mode-working-with-overseas-scientists/",,"2023-09-28 12:15",,,,,,,"Hasan Yesilkaya (HY3)","Russell Wallis (RW73)",,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,"Partner not Listed","De Montfort University",,,"LS: Respiratory Sciences",,"LS: Respiratory Sciences","LS: Respiratory Sciences",,"LS: Respiratory Sciences",,,,,,"99 - Not Applicable for Institute reporting",,"Janet Harris (JH68)",,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Not Applicable for HEBCI","Not applicable for HEBCI",,"2023-06-27 11:28",,,,,,"There is a two-stage application process: EOI three months' ahead of full application (latter by 28.09.23).

"Targeting the hearing loss following bacterial meningitis with toxin inhibitors",Toxininhibit,"Objective
We will test four recently identified low-molecular weight inhibitors of the pneumococcal toxin, pneumolysin, for efficacy in prevention of pneumococcal-induced hearing loss. Two are pro-drugs and two are the active components of the pro-drugs.

Background
Permanent loss of hearing is a frequent long-term pathological consequence for survivors of meningitis due to Streptococcus pneumoniae [1]. Many studies have shown that the cochlear hair cells and the spiral ganglion neurons are damaged [see2]. Various pneumococcal factors may contribute to its virulence, but overwhelmingly the evidence points to pneumolysin being the cause of the hearing loss. For example, many in vivo and ex vivo experiments show that damage is abolished in infection with mutated pneumococci that lack the ply gene [see2]. 
Pneumolysin is produced by virtually all strains in the cytoplasm but is released when the bacterium lyses naturally, or under the effect of lytic antibiotics, when a large bolus of toxin is released. Thus, even if antibiotics successfully clear the bacteria, the release of the toxin occurs and can cause long-term consequences. The impact of pneumolysin can be its direct toxicity to host cells and indirectly by inducing a vigorous host inflammatory response [3,4]. In this proposal we will test the hypothesis that: inhibition of the toxin would protect from the bacterial and host mediated hearing loss. 
To improve prognosis, adjunctive therapy has been used to support antimicrobial therapy. However, so far use of adjunctives has sought to reduce morbidity by reducing host inflammatory responses rather than by combating direct toxicity. The most common current adjunctive is dexamethasone but even when used, significant mortality and morbidity is seen, and its use is debated due to non-specific effects limiting clinical impact and, in some cases, increasing neuronal apoptosis [5,6].
Twin platforms for combatting any bacterial infectious disease are vaccination and treatment and both must be employed to maximise protection. Nevertheless, there are some that advocate that new treatments for pneumococcal diseases are not necessary because vaccines will solve the problems. This is mis-guided. Even though the new conjugate vaccines have shown success in some circumstances, two huge problems with a vaccine-only approach are the occurrence of over ninety pneumococcal serotypes (the best new vaccines only target thirteen), plus the phenomenon of serotype replacement within pneumococci. These factors prevent reliable prediction of the wider impact of conjugate vaccines [7].
Data on the impact of conjugate vaccines on hearing loss in England and Wales are lacking but a recent study of children [8] found that pneumococcal vaccination reduced the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease but death still occurred in 4.8% but, significantly, most of the deaths were due to pneumococcal serotypes not covered in the vaccines. Data from the USA [9] showed a decrease (72%) in meningitis by serotypes covered by the conjugate vaccine but a rise (46%) in disease by non-vaccine serotypes. Hearing loss was documented in 29% of the children, but there was no significant difference in the proportion of children who developed sequelae according to immunisation status. A later study [10] found that pneumococcal meningitis did not change after the PCV13 replaced PCV7, and there were no significant differences in complications or death. The authors also found similar sequelae rates among survivors of PCV13 and non-PCV13 meningitis.
The weight of evidence for the importance of pneumolysin in hearing loss led us to the conclusion that pneumolysin constitutes a potential new therapeutic target. Previous research showed the ability of cholesterol to inhibit pneumolysin, but this is merely due to the fact that cholesterol is a natural cellular receptor of pneumolysin, that is important for the pore formation in the target cell membrane. Cholesterol is not considered as a therapy for pneumococcal diseases and has not been clinically used in patients. Another compound, allicin, has been reported to inhibit pneumolysin haemolytic activity in vitro but it is a cysteine inhibitor. Compounds exhibiting such a property are unfavourable as drug candidates because of their potential off-target effects. In an original take on this issue, we surmised that a better approach was to identify low-molecular weight, non-thiol dependent, pneumolysin inhibitors with classical drug-like properties. 
We envisaged that the drug would be given as an adjunctive simultaneously with the first doses of antibiotics. Discovery of a drug with a good safety profile, and because of the frequency of the pneumococcus as the cause of bacterial meningitis, would be compatible with empirical administration. Consequently, we undertook research to develop such a product. Using our high-throughput assay and a set of well-established in vitro, ex vivo and in vitro assays, we screened 250,000 compounds and identified five leads that inhibited toxin activity in vivo and in vitro. Then we undertook a medicinal chemistry programme to optimise pneumolysin-inhibiting lead compounds in which over 900 derivatives of the leads were synthesised to optimise their physicochemical properties, key absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) properties, in vivo pharmacokinetics (PK) properties and maximise the in vivo potency (PD) of derivatives. The synthesised compounds were tested in a cascade of in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo assays. In the mouse and rat, these preclinical candidates have strong biological efficacy (IC50 0.15µM in vitro and in vivo), favourable ADME and safety profile, attractive physicochemical properties compatible with parenteral formulation and are amenable to large scale production.",527714,,,"Bid Awaiting Response",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",3,2024-02-01,2027-01-31,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"Funder not listed - UK Charity","Funder not listed - UK Charity Default Scheme","UK Charities (Open Competition & External Peer Review)","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"Translational Research Grant",,https://rnid.org.uk/hearing-research/im-a-researcher-looking-for-funding/translational-grant/,,"2023-03-31 09:55",300000.00,"2023-06-26 12:03",,"2024-06-25 00:00",,,"Hasan Yesilkaya (HY3)","Marco Rinaldo Oggioni (MRO5)",,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,,,,"LS: Respiratory Sciences","LS: Genetics & Genome Biology","LS: Genetics & Genome Biology,LS: Respiratory Sciences","LS: Respiratory Sciences","LS: Genetics & Genome Biology","LS: Genetics & Genome Biology,LS: Respiratory Sciences",,,,,,"99 - Not Applicable for Institute reporting","UNITED KINGDOM","Janet Harris (JH68)",,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Clinical medicine",,,,"Not Applicable for HEBCI","Not applicable for HEBCI",,"2023-03-28 14:38",,,,,,"The Royal National Institute for Deaf People, is not listed as the funder.",279759.80,279759.80,627604.04,627604.04,279759.80,279759.80,-347844.24,44.58,-3180.01,-1.14,-73077.84,-26.12,279759.80,279759.80,0.00,279759.80,0.00,279759.80,282939.80,282939.80,279759.80,279759.80,0.00,279759.80,0.00,279759.80,99038.17,62000.00,4200.00,140421.83,69897.83,62931.60,7592.40,204242.40,0.00,279759.80,279759.80,627604.04,627604.04,279759.80,279759.80,-347844.24,44.58,-3180.01,-1.14,-73077.84,-26.12,"2023-06-26 12:03:19",,Discoverable,,"2023-03-24 09:38:43","Hasan Yesilkaya (HY3)","2023-06-26 12:03"

"Contrast-free evaluation of scarring within the heart using cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging",CONFIRM,"Heart disease costs the NHS over £9billion annually.  Each year, over 100,000 people suffer a heart attack, resulting in permanent scarring of their heart. Survivors are at increased risk of sudden death or developing heart failure, a debilitating condition. Currently, doctors do not have very good tools to predict who will and will not develop complications.   

Pictures of ‘scarring’ within the heart can be obtained using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), after giving patients a ‘dye’ (a gadolinium compound). This provides an accurate method to identify even small heart attacks. However, giving this dye adds cost, and it is not safe in some people (with advanced kidney disease or allergic reactions); its long-term effects are also currently unknown. Moving ‘cine’ images of the heart are routinely acquired, and do not require any dye to be given. Hence, it would be advantageous to use these dye-free images to identify scar. This project aims to develop and test a fully automatic computer program using artificial intelligence (AI) to ‘convert’ the dye-free images into scar images. Hence, a new method to identify scarring within the heart will be developed and validated.",512567,,,"Bid Unsuccessful",Locked,Unsuccessful,"Gerry McCann (GPM12),Kerry Warner (KW153),Pre-award Admin,Ranjit Arnold (JRA14),Sally Utton (SU47),Shuihua Wang (SW546)",2,2023-10-01,2025-03-31,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"UKRI UK Research and Innovation UKRI","UKRI Default Scheme","Research Councils - UKRI","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"Artificial intelligence innovation to accelerate health research",,https://www.ukri.org/opportunity/artificial-intelligence-innovation-to-accelerate-health-research/,https://www.ukri.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/UKRI-22022023-UKRI-Artificial-intelligence-innovation-to-accelerate-health-research-webinar-QA-FINAL.pdf,"2023-03-28 11:25",750000.00,"2023-03-28 13:22",,"2024-03-27 00:00",,,"Gerry McCann (GPM12)","Shuihua Wang (SW546),Ranjit Arnold (JRA14)","Kerry Warner (KW153),Sally Utton (SU47)","Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,"King's College London,University of Birmingham",,,"LS: Cardiovascular Sciences","Computing and Mathematical Sciences","Computing and Mathematical Sciences,LS: Cardiovascular Sciences","LS: Cardiovascular Sciences","SE/CM: Computing Sciences","LS: Cardiovascular Sciences,SE/CM: Computing Sciences",,,,,,"99 - Not Applicable for Institute reporting",,"Kerry Warner (KW153)",,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin","Carl Edwards (CE133)",,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2023-03-27 23:47",,,,,,,568135.59,568135.59,721020.15,721020.15,710169.49,710169.49,-152884.56,78.8,189384.49,33.33,132722.49,23.36,368957.60,710169.49,0.00,710169.49,0.00,710169.49,378751.10,378551.10,368757.60,710169.49,0.00,710169.49,0.00,710169.49,154224.70,7200.00,0.00,162690.38,56662.00,48291.26,5826.11,179578.68,0.00,508165.99,508165.99,646058.15,646058.15,635207.49,635207.49,-137892.16,78.66,129614.89,25.51,72952.89,14.36,"2023-06-16 12:43:07",,Discoverable,,"2023-03-06 11:22:12","Ranjit Arnold (JRA14)","2023-06-16 12:44"

"Regulation of the X chromosome in pluripotency, development and disease","AMS Springboard","Successful development requires a unique regulation of gene expression on the X chromosome due to the different number of X chromosomes between males and females. In placental mammals, X chromosome dosage compensation occurs by X chromosome inactivation (XCI), which transcriptionally silences most genes on one of the two X chromosomes in females and thereby equalizes X-linked gene expression with XY males. The silenced state of the inactive X (Xi) will be remembered by daughter cells and play a crucial role in cell physiology. Its dysregulation is involved in over 500 X-linked diseases including immune diseases, cancer and during ageing. In the blastocyst, the long non-coding RNA XIST is expressed from one of the two active X chromosomes to trigger and mediate XCI. XIST functions by recruiting dozens of effectors proteins. In the mouse, I recently showed that XIST functions by seeding large macromolecular assemblies of silencing proteins. I also revealed that perturbations in protein-protein interactions within XIST assemblies leads to partial or complete X chromosome reactivation (XCR). 

hPSCs are critical to cell therapies and modelling gene regulation in early human embryonic development, which is vital to understanding what is required for a healthy pregnancy. Naïve and primed hPSCs, correspond to the pluripotency states of pre- and post-implantation epiblasts. XCI is essential to cell identity and physiology and the epigenetic instability of the Xi in female human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), owing to partial XCR occurring with prolonged culturing, generates a huge obstacle for their applicability in regenerative medicine. The formation, composition and regulation of XIST assemblies in hPSCs and what are the differences between naïve and primed hPSCs remain unknown. Furthermore, we still lack knowledge on how we can completely reprogram primed to naïve hPSCs to revert XIST expression and reactivate a wild-type X chromosome in diseases where a mutant X is active, for example in the Rett syndrome.",549161,,,"Bid Awaiting Response",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",2,2024-03-01,2026-02-28,,"RF - Research Fellowship",Research,"Legacy Project Cancer","ACADEMY OF MEDICAL S The Academy of Medical Sciences","ACADEMY OF MEDICAL S Default Scheme","UK Charities (Open Competition & External Peer Review)","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"Springboard round 9",,https://acmedsci.ac.uk/grants-and-schemes/grant-schemes/springboard,,"2023-06-15 16:00",125000.00,"2023-06-15 12:30",,"2024-06-14 00:00",,,"Yolanda Markaki (GM365)",,,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,,,,"LS: Molecular & Cell Biology",,"LS: Molecular & Cell Biology","LS: Molecular & Cell Biology",,"LS: Molecular & Cell Biology",,No,,,,"99 - Not Applicable for Institute reporting",,"Kerry Warner (KW153)",,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Not Applicable for HEBCI","Not applicable for HEBCI",,"2023-06-13 13:05",,,,,,"I am not entirely sure if the cap can go up to £150000",124392.00,124392.00,162090.86,162090.86,124392.00,124392.00,-37698.86,76.74,5100.00,4.1,-14281.10,-11.48,119292.00,124392.00,0.00,124392.00,0.00,124392.00,119292.00,119292.00,119292.00,124392.00,0.00,124392.00,0.00,124392.00,119292.00,36570.00,58082.00,29182.70,19381.10,4195.44,506.16,13616.16,0.00,124392.00,124392.00,162090.86,162090.86,124392.00,124392.00,-37698.86,76.74,5100.00,4.1,-14281.10,-11.48,"2023-06-15 17:48:47",,Discoverable,,"2023-05-10 13:46:33","Yolanda Markaki (GM365)","2023-06-15 17:48"
"HWO-EES: Habitable Worlds Observatory - Early Engagement Support",HWO-EES,"The Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) has been selected by NASA as its next flagship space astronomy mission, following on from Hubble, Webb and Rubin telescopes. A principal scientific goal of HWO is to search for Earth-like planets in nearby interstellar space (within a few 10s of parsecs) and characterise their surfaces and/or atmospheres through direct spectroscopic observations in the search for evidence of life processes. This programme will answer the question “Are We Alone?”, one of the most exciting and fundamental in modern science. If no direct evidence for life is found, by surveying a sufficiently large population of objects, it will be possible to provide important and interesting constraints on the presence of life in the Galaxy. Like Hubble and Webb, HWO will also be a general-purpose observatory able to provide revolutionary capability in many areas of astrophysics and planetary science. As with Hubble and Webb before, the timescale for development, build and launch of HWO is measured in decades, with an expected launch in the early 2040s (although it is hoped to accelerate work to bring this forward). HWO is currently planned to be a 6-m aperture UVOIR telescope.

"Matching Skills: Capabilities, Organisations And Institutions",Skills2Capabilities,"he Skills2Capability project is about understanding how skill systems across Europe can reduce the level of skills mismatch in their labour markets. It is recognised that future labour markets will be more mobile with more people moving between jobs, employers, and sectors more often. This poses a problem for training systems insofar as employers may be much less willing than in the past to fund and provide training because their chances of appropriating the return will have been reduced. The study is concerned with understanding how skill systems can better respond to meeting skill demands in a more fluid labour market environment. The starting point is that of considering whether there is a need to provide individuals with a wider range of capabilities to weather a greater range of labour market challenges than those faced by their counterparts from previous generations. Some countries have been able to use their skills systems to deliver more of these capabilities than others, though the impact of this on labour market transitions is uncertain (something the current study addresses). If skills systems are to confer skills on individuals which provide them with increased resilience and capability, then there is a need to know what those capabilities or skills are in practice. The research addresses this from both a demand side (what are the skills which are currently in demand and are likely to be so in the future?) and a supply side (to what extent are these capabilities reflected in VET programmes) perspective. The research will provide decision makers in government and education authorities with information which allows them to obtain a better understanding of how emerging skill needs - which meet the needs of both economy and society - can be met (essentially providing a methodology and a tool), along with detailed information about the content of those emerging skill needs and capabilities (i.e. detailed data on demand and supply).",565003,,,"Bid Submission",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",3,2023-01-16,2025-12-31,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"EPSRC HEG EPSRC - Horizon Europe Guarantee","EPSRC HEG Default Scheme","Research Councils - EPSRC","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,Horizon-CL2-2022-Transformations-01,,https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/horizon-cl2-2022-transformations-01-01,,"2023-04-20 12:30",,,,,,,"Sally-Anne Barnes (SB1053)",,,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,"University of Warwick",,,,"SS/BU: Work, Emp, M'ment & Org, Dept",,"SS/BU: Work, Emp, M'ment & Org, Dept","SS/BU: Work, Emp, M'ment & Org, Dept",,"SS/BU: Work, Emp, M'ment & Org, Dept",,,,,,,,,,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2023-06-08 16:53",,,,,,"The proposal was submitted when I was at Warwick.

"MS3: AI based Microsatellite Stability Screening of Colorectal and Endometrial Cancers",MS3,"In the UK, the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and Royal College of Pathologists (RCPath) guidelines mandate that all colorectal cancer (CRC) and endometrial cancer (EC) samples must be tested for deficient Mismatch Repair (dMMR) system in order to detect Lynch Syndrom (LS), a genetic disorder that puts patients and their relatives at high risk of developing other cancers, and to provide prognostically useful information and key data that may be used to guide therapy for sporadic CRC and EC patients that have Microsatellite Instability (MSI). Similarly, the European ESMO guidelines and the CAP guidelines in the USA mandate MSI testing for CRCs and ECs. The current Standard of Care (SoC) for dMMR/MSI testing of all CRC and EC tumours involves performing either immunohistochemistry (IHC) with 4 antibodies against the mismatch repair proteins MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2 (MMR-IHC) or molecular pathology testing by PCR amplification of a panel of microsatellite markers (PCRMSI) in tumour DNA or both, although next generation sequencing (NGS) based solutions for MSI testing are also becoming popular. The SoC testing is slow (up to 3 weeks per case) and expensive in terms of antibody costs, laboratory staining, IHC or PCR processing, technician and pathologist times for interpreting results and reporting.
This large multi-disciplinary project will build on our existing proof-of-principle artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm that has already demonstrated state-of-the-art results for discrimination between MSI/dMMR and Microsatellite Stable (MSS) tumours from digitised high-resolution microscopic images of routine diagnostic Haematoxylin & Eosin (H&E) sections, by leveraging the power of billions of raw pixels per image. By further incorporating interpretable AI technology recently developed by our group, we aim to achieve 70% specificity at 99% sensitivity. The proposed MS3 tool will be refined, optimised, tested for its robustness and finally validated on a large number of CRC and EC cases (totalling >14,000, consisting of both resections and biopsies) from 5 NHS sites and 6 non-UK hospital sites. The project will produce definitive evidence for efficiency and accuracy of the MS3 tool, paving the way for its deployment in the UK and beyond. If successfully validated and implemented, the MS3 tool will serve as a diagnostic triaging tool (rather than replacing the SoC) and is expected to screen out 70-80% of CRC/EC cases that are highly likely to be MSS without any additional testing required, leading to testing efficiency, patient benefits and NHS cost savings.",500479,,,"Bid Unsuccessful",Locked,Unsuccessful,"Esther Moss (EM321),Pre-award Admin",3,2023-10-01,2026-09-30,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"INNOVATE UK Innovate UK","INNOVATE UK Default Scheme","UK Central Government","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"Biomedical Catalyst 2023 Round 1: Industry-led R&D",,https://apply-for-innovation-funding.service.gov.uk/competition/1427/overview/08a0b0b3-bd08-4226-836f-57b25f459621,,"2023-03-01 09:05",,"2023-03-02 15:25",,"2024-03-01 00:00",,,"Esther Moss (EM321)",,,"Only people involved in this project",,"Partner not Listed",Yes,,,"University Hospitals Coventry &,University of Cambridge,UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH,University of Leeds",,"LS/GG: Cancer Research Centre",,"LS/GG: Cancer Research Centre","LS/GG: Cancer Research Centre",,"LS/GG: Cancer Research Centre",,Yes,,,,"99 - Not Applicable for Institute reporting",,"Yelena Mazulina (YM41)",,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2023-02-23 18:26",,,,,,,52785.41,52785.41,60073.55,60073.55,60073.55,60073.55,-7288.14,87.87,29152.55,55.23,4160.46,7.88,23632.86,60073.55,0.00,60073.55,0.00,60073.55,23632.86,23632.86,23632.86,60073.55,0.00,60073.55,0.00,60073.55,23632.86,0.00,0.00,27930.59,24992.09,2622.15,316.35,8510.10,0.00,52785.41,52785.41,60073.55,60073.55,60073.55,60073.55,-7288.14,87.87,29152.55,55.23,4160.46,7.88,"2023-06-07 16:58:49",,Discoverable,,"2023-02-17 09:03:11","Esther Moss (EM321)","2023-06-07 16:58"

"Improving dysphagia identification and management in hospital (IDIAMH): A feasibility study",IDIAMH,"Background
Problems with swallowing are very common in older people. When food, liquids and medicines accidentally go into a patient’s lungs, they take bacteria and viruses with them and these can cause pneumonia. This is either the main or second most common cause of death in people with dementia, stroke and Parkinson’s.  Swallowing problems are very high in these patient groups and there is a strong link between swallowing problems and death due to pneumonia.  
Older people with swallowing problems in hospital have also been shown to be at much greater risk of medication errors because nurses are often expected to give medicines such as tablets and capsules, to patients who cannot safely take them.  These patients need a medication review to ensure that medicines are only given by mouth if needed and the best type of medicine e.g. liquid, patch is used for them. 

It is therefore important that swallowing problems in older people are quickly identified to ensure that all swallowing is made as safe as possible. Swallowing problems are, however, frequently not identified or reported in hospital. There is evidence that improving identification of swallowing problems can improve patient quality of life and reduce length of stay. A new way to improve how we identify and care for older people with swallowing problems in hospital is therefore required. 

Aims
To develop an approach which encourages nurses to identify swallowing problems as part of usual practice and refer to speech and language therapists and pharmacists to increase the likelihood of a safe swallow and reduce the likelihood of medication errors.

Methods
We will work with hospital-based nurses on care of the older person wards, speech and language therapists and pharmacists to develop an approach to improving how swallowing problems are identified and then referred for review to ensure a safe swallow and medicines-related practices. We will use theory to underpin the design of our approach to improve how well it works.

We will then test the approach in a small number of older peoples’ wards to see if it is acceptable and feasible and to inform the design of a study to test it. 

Patient & Public Involvement
Patients and public have been involved in the design of the research project and will be involved throughout: design, collection of information, analysis, writing papers and reports and working in partnership with the team to present the results. 
Dissemination

As a feasibility study, we will publish what we have learned from others about the problem we are trying to address and how to test an approach effectively in relevant healthcare journals.  This can be used to develop approaches to improving care for people with swallowing problems in hospital.",537231,,,"Bid Awaiting Response",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",2,2024-02-01,2026-01-31,,"RC - Research Clinical Trial",Research,,"NIHR National Institute of Health Research","NIHR Default Scheme","UK Central Government","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"Under-represented discipline and specialisms highlight notice: Nurses and Midwives call",,https://www.nihr.ac.uk/funding/rfpb-under-represented-disciplines-and-specialisms-highlight-notice-nurses-and-midwives/32059,,"2023-05-17 13:00",500000.00,"2023-05-12 12:00",,"2024-05-11 00:00",,,"David Wright (DJW57)","Linda Birt (LB484),Noelle Robertson (NR6)",,"Only people involved in this project",,"Leicestershire Partnership NHS Trust",Yes,,,,,"LS/HC: Healthcare Research",,"LS/HC: Healthcare Research","LS/HC: Healthcare Research",,"LS/HC: Healthcare Research",,Yes,,,,,,"Yusuf Dedat (YD134)",,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2023-05-12 16:15",,,,,,,43816.02,43816.02,55343.11,55343.11,54770.03,54770.03,-11527.09,79.17,43816.02,100,7680.11,17.53,0.00,54770.03,0.00,54770.03,0.00,54770.03,0.00,0.00,0.00,54770.03,0.00,54770.03,0.00,54770.03,0.00,0.00,0.00,38322.91,36135.91,2187.00,0.00,17020.20,0.00,43816.02,43816.02,55343.11,55343.11,54770.03,54770.03,-11527.09,79.17,43816.02,100,7680.11,17.53,"2023-06-06 11:58:24",,Discoverable,,"2023-04-14 15:19:05","David Wright (DJW57)","2023-06-06 11:58"
"Exploring the mechanisms of exercise-induced cardiovascular remodelling in haemodialysis patients: the role of microRNAs",,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in haemodialysis patients. Current clinical management is limited to reducing traditional risk factors, which unfortunately has little effect on outcomes as CVD is driven by different factors in this population. Currently no other treatment options are available. Recently our group has shown six-months of intradialytic cycling resulted in cardiac remodelling and reduced left ventricular mass (CYCLE-HD study). Whilst this provides a potential therapy for those able and willing to exercise, a large proportion of the population is not medically stable, or have other barriers preventing their participation. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms through which exercise provided these cardioprotective benefits is vital in the development of other therapies that may be more accessible.

"Children’s Perspectives on Disaster Relief and Recovery in Turkey: Lessons from the 2023 Turkey-Syria Earthquake",,"Disasters have a devastating impact on thousands of people, with children being one of the most vulnerable groups. In the aftermath of a disaster, it is vital to understand the specific needs of children to improve the effective prevention and recovery approaches, minimize the challenges of disasters and create a better future for them. However, despite the significance of involving children in the recovery process, there is little research that emphasises children’s active participation in sharing their experiences. This work fills a gap in investigating children’s perspectives on disaster relief and recovery in the aftermath of the 2023 Turkey-Syria earthquake in Turkey. A qualitative research design will be used to investigate the experiences of children, their families and the first responders. This will provide context to learn more about the experiences and difficulties that children face after a disaster and how these difficulties can be overcome more effectively in the future. This work also aims to highlight the difficulties of families and first responders when supporting children, difficulties that have not been investigated before. The findings will offer valuable insights for practitioners, stakeholders and policymakers in disaster relief and recovery to support children effectively. Moreover, it will help children’s voices and needs be heard in times of crisis.",541165,,,"Bid Awaiting Response",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",2,2023-09-01,2024-12-31,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"BRITISH ACADEMY The British Academy","BA/Leverhulme Small Research Grants","Research Councils (BEIS) - Roy Society and Brit Academy","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"BA/Leverhulme Small Research Grant Scheme",,https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/funding/ba-leverhulme-small-research-grants/,,"2023-05-30 17:00",,"2023-05-24 16:30",,"2024-05-23 00:00",,,"Ayse Yildiz (AY111)",,,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,,,,"SS/BU: M'ing, Innov', Str'gy & Ops, Dept",,"SS/BU: M'ing, Innov', Str'gy & Ops, Dept","SS/BU: M'ing, Innov', Str'gy & Ops, Dept",,"SS/BU: M'ing, Innov', Str'gy & Ops, Dept",,,,,,,,,,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2023-05-23 15:46",,,,,,,6100.00,6100.00,31268.97,31268.97,6100.00,6100.00,-25168.97,19.51,0.00,0,-12364.17,-202.69,6100.00,6100.00,0.00,6100.00,0.00,6100.00,6100.00,6100.00,6100.00,6100.00,0.00,6100.00,0.00,6100.00,6100.00,0.00,0.00,13822.17,12364.17,1458.00,0.00,11346.80,0.00,6100.00,6100.00,31268.97,31268.97,6100.00,6100.00,-25168.97,19.51,0.00,0,-12364.17,-202.69,"2023-06-02 16:31:40",,Private,,"2023-04-23 17:23:36","Ayse Yildiz (AY111)","2023-06-02 16:31"

"""Owning our roots"": An ethnographic and historical inquiry into the ongoing construction of Egyptian Anglicanism",,"This project investigates the recent postcolonial development of the Episcopal/Anglican Church in Egypt and the lived realities of its members. Having recently renounced many of its ties with the English 'Mother Church,' and facing pressure on a variety of fronts, the Egyptian Episcopal/Anglican Church is experiencing turbulent times. Recently upgraded from a diocese to a province, it is also flourishing, with a growing membership. This project explores how the Episcopal/Anglican Church has changed in recent years and the degree to which a new discourse of Egyptian Anglicanism – as an indigenous expression of an ancient form of Christianity – has taken root within a range of settings. The methodology involves training local interviewers to to gather information from fellow church members across this community. Permission for interviews has been granted by the current Archbishop of the Episcopal/Anglican Province of Alexandria. The project aims to fill a gap in the literature regarding the workings of the contemporary, postcolonial Episcopal/Anglican Church in Egypt.",552763,,,"Bid Awaiting Response",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",2,2023-09-01,2025-08-31,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"BRITISH ACADEMY The British Academy","BA/Leverhulme Small Research Grants","Research Councils (BEIS) - Roy Society and Brit Academy","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"BA/Leverhulme Small Research Grants SRG 2023 Round",,https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/funding/ba-leverhulme-small-research-grants/,,"2023-05-31 12:45",10000.00,"2023-05-31 10:03",,"2024-05-30 00:00",,,"James Moore (JM68)",,,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,,,,"SS/HP: History",,"SS/HP: History","SS/HP: History",,"SS/HP: History",,,,,,"99 - Not Applicable for Institute reporting",,"Ellen Puurman (EP258)",,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2023-05-25 16:56",,,,,,"Project Co-Investigators - Dr Richard Gauvain (British University in Egypt, Egypt) and Dr Monika Lindbekk (University of Bergen, Nowray).",9900.00,9900.00,23940.28,23940.28,9900.00,9900.00,-14040.28,41.35,0.00,0,-7637.88,-77.15,9900.00,9900.00,0.00,9900.00,0.00,9900.00,9900.00,9900.00,9900.00,9900.00,0.00,9900.00,0.00,9900.00,9900.00,400.00,0.00,8366.88,7637.88,729.00,0.00,5673.40,0.00,9900.00,9900.00,23940.28,23940.28,9900.00,9900.00,-14040.28,41.35,0.00,0,-7637.88,-77.15,"2023-05-31 10:03:18",,Discoverable,,"2023-05-16 12:42:20","James Moore (JM68)","2023-05-31 10:03"
"Defining the effects of telomere length on coronary artery disease",TeloPlaq,"​​Telomere length (TL), a marker of cellular age, is causally associated with coronary artery disease (CAD), however, the underlying genetic and mechanistic interaction remains ill-defined. TeloPlaq aims to elucidate the overlapping genetics between TL and CAD, investigate the regulatory gene networks associated with TL, and study the interaction with (environmental) risk factors and sex. Finally, TeloPlaq aims to develop methods to interrogate TL at cellular resolution in situ and will study the role of TL and prospective key target genes in vitro and in vivo on vascular and circulatory cell behaviour and atherosclerosis. The output of these efforts will provide an explanation of the contribution of TL to CAD risk with the potential to inform future treatment strategies.",542554,,,"Bid Awaiting Response",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",4,2024-04-01,2028-03-31,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"BHF British Heart Foundation","BRITISH HEART Default Scheme","UK Charities (Open Competition & External Peer Review)","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"BHF-DZHK-DHF International Cardiovascular Research Partnership Awards",,https://www.bhf.org.uk/for-professionals/information-for-researchers/what-we-fund/partnership-funding/bhf-dzhk-dhf,,"2023-05-24 23:00",500000.00,"2023-05-24 16:20",,"2024-05-23 00:00",,,"Christopher Nelson (CN46)","Veryan Codd (VC15),Thomas Webb (TW126)",,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,"Partner not Listed",,,,"LS: Cardiovascular Sciences",,"LS: Cardiovascular Sciences","LS: Cardiovascular Sciences",,"LS: Cardiovascular Sciences",,No,,,,"99 - Not Applicable for Institute reporting","GERMANY,NETHERLANDS,UNITED KINGDOM","Kerry Warner (KW153)",,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Clinical medicine",,,,"Not Applicable for HEBCI","Not applicable for HEBCI",,"2023-05-23 11:17",,,,,,"This is a resubmission of our proposal from 2022 to the same scheme.",499697.80,499697.80,1245759.81,1245759.81,499697.80,499697.80,-746062.01,40.11,-1462.40,-0.29,-143102.41,-28.64,499697.80,499697.80,0.00,499697.80,0.00,499697.80,501160.20,501160.20,499697.80,499697.80,0.00,499697.80,0.00,499697.80,109550.00,99750.00,1000.00,296401.01,141640.01,138099.90,16661.10,448198.60,0.00,499697.80,499697.80,1245759.81,1245759.81,499697.80,499697.80,-746062.01,40.11,-1462.40,-0.29,-143102.41,-28.64,"2023-05-31 09:47:20",,Discoverable,,"2023-04-25 14:59:11","Christopher Nelson (CN46)","2023-05-31 09:47"

"Specifically targeted smart nano-pills based on synthetic antibodies for treatment of DMG on a mouse model",,"Specific drug delivery using nanotechnology to fatal paediatric brain tumours such as DMG is an extremely promising treatment approach. DMG is an extremely aggressive cancer, and surgical resection or chemotherapy are not possible for the most DMG. The primary reasons of failure are the deep embedment of cancer cells into the brain, and the challenge of delivering sufficient doses of chemotherapeutics across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). 
PEGylated-molecularly-imprinted nanosized synthetic antibodies (SA-NPs) will be developed to achieve nontoxic and actively targeted delivery to the interleukin 13 receptor alpha-2 on the DMG cells. Our strategy will be based on polyamine-blocking therapy, the well-known and most promising therapy against DMG for preclinical applications. The SA-NPs will be loaded with a synergetic combination of ornithine decarboxylase 1 inhibitor difluoromethylornithine (DMFO) and polyamine transport inhibitor AMXT-1501. Also, we will prepare the reduction-responsive delivery system based on glutathione, which is overexpressed in tumour tissue, to obtain tumour-specific drug release. We will test these novel nanotechnology-based combined therapeutic strategies, in an advanced pre-clinic in-vivo mouse model of DMG.",538611,,,"Bid Development",,Pending,"Pre-award Admin,Sergey Piletsky (SP523)",4,2023-12-01,2027-05-31,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,"Legacy Project Cancer","Funder not listed - UK Charity","Funder not listed - UK Charity Default Scheme","UK Charities (Open Competition & External Peer Review)","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"Brain Research UK 2023 project grants: call for applications Preliminary application stage",,https://www.brainresearchuk.org.uk/research/apply/project-grant,,"2023-04-20 15:30",300000.00,,,,,,"Sergey Piletsky (SP523)",,,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,,"Institute of Cancer Research,University of East Anglia",,"SE/CH: Chemical Biology",,"SE/CH: Chemical Biology","SE/CH: Chemical Biology",,"SE/CH: Chemical Biology",,,,,,,,,,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.00,,0.00,,0.00,0.00,0,0.00,0,0.00,0,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,,0.00,,0.00,,0.00,0,0.00,0,0.00,0,"2023-05-30 14:15:24",,Private,,"2023-04-18 15:06:31","Sergey Piletsky (SP523)","2023-06-01 11:46"

"Human Rights Law and Health: Future Directions (workshop 2)",,"We seek funding for a second workshop as part of our collaborative project on human rights law and health, which will culminate in the publication of a Research Handbook on Human Rights Law and Health, to be published by Elgar in 2025. Our vision for this project is not only to engage with the varied elements of human rights law in the context of health, but also to reflect current debates which challenge traditional perspectives of rights such as decolonisation, feminism and social models of disability, and seek to identify the future directions of human rights and health. This is funding application for a workshop that will follow our launch workshop in which invited collaborators will test their ideas in a series of mini presentations, and round-table discussions.

This second workshop aims to create a space for contributors to the collection to present first drafts of their papers, which will allow a smoother editing procedure.

"Insular Manuscripts in the Age of Charlemagne",INSULAR,"Between c.600–900CE manuscripts were made in Ireland and England using ‘insular’ styles of writing, decoration and membrane that are distinctive and diagnostic. Insular manuscripts and bookmaking methods were also taken to the continent by scholars and missionaries from the islands and were used by them and their students in Francia. Around 850 insular manuscripts survive in modern libraries. By deploying an innovative digital toolkit and breakthrough biocodicological methods (aDNA/proteomics), alongside foundational palaeographical, codicological and art historical tools, INSULAR will analyse the complete corpus of these manuscripts for the first time, to identify differences between manuscripts written on the islands and those made in Francia, and
investigate in new ways the contribution of the islands of Britain and Ireland to the intellectual and material culture of early medieval Europe in the Age of Charlemagne.

We will do this by: producing a comprehensive, open access database of all items in insular script made before c.900; refining methods for distinguishing between insular manuscripts made on the islands from those made in Francia; analysing membrane through visual analysis, photometric stereo recording and biocodicological methods to study methods of making membrane, distinguish between sheep and calfskin, and ‘postcode’ manuscripts made of calfskin; exploring graphic and chronological dynamics between insular and caroline
minuscule, particularly in continental scriptoria; exploring readers’ engagement with books containing insular script.

We aim to transform understanding of the influence of scripts, scribes and scholars from Britain and Ireland in post-Roman Europe through interdisciplinary investigations of INSULAR manuscripts that are both qualitative and quantitative, and which combine new forms of evidence captured by innovative digital and biomolecular technologies alongside well-established scientific tools and principles.",458322,,,"Bid Awaiting Response",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",5,2024-10-01,2029-09-30,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"ERC European Research Council (ERC)","ERC Default Scheme","EU Government Bodies (inc European Commission but not UK)","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"ERC Advanced",,https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/erc-2023-adg,,"2023-05-23 16:00",2024291.50,"2023-05-22 10:25",,"2024-05-19 00:00",,,"Joanna Story (JS73)",,,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,"Bibliothèque nationale de France, Bibliothèque Richelieu,Katholieke Universiteit Leuven,Royal Danish Library,Trinity College Dublin,University of Cambridge,University of Göttingen,University of Oxford",,,"SS/HP: History",,"SS/HP: History","SS/HP: History",,"SS/HP: History",,,,,,"99 - Not Applicable for Institute reporting",,"Ellen Puurman (EP258)",,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2023-05-18 09:25",,,,,,"There are two budgets, second budget is indicating 30% to be spent out of PI research allocation.",2023898.00,2023898.00,2341246.83,2341246.83,2023898.00,2023898.00,-317348.83,86.45,878875.56,43.42,532185.73,26.3,1143584.26,2023898.00,0.00,2023898.00,0.00,2023898.00,1145022.44,576545.93,575107.75,2023898.00,0.00,2023898.00,0.00,2023898.00,191892.80,10372.80,0.00,539223.97,346689.82,61965.00,0.00,657000.41,0.00,1150090.93,1150090.93,1467439.76,1467439.76,1150090.93,1150090.93,-317348.83,78.37,573545.00,49.87,226855.17,19.72,"2023-05-26 09:19:25",,Discoverable,,"2023-01-19 10:39:11","Ellen Puurman (EP258)","2023-06-01 15:57"
"Understanding Solastalgia, Environmental Restoration and Sustainability",USERS,"The project will explore the social and environmental processes framing  place-based experiences of sustainability by analysing two interrelated processes: 
- the emergence of solastalgia in relation to overtourism and industrial development; and
-  the deployment of environmental and social restorative justice initiatives through rewilding and other community-based initiatives.

Solastalgia is the mental health distress produced by environmental change and affecting people while they are directly connected to their home environment. 

Ecological Restoration refers to the process of supporting the recovery of a damaged environment in ways that reflect both its intrinsic ecological value and its social and cultural value for local populations.

The project will compare different local experiences of compromised social and environmental sustainability in relation to two key economic forces threatening contemporary socio-environmental settings: tourism  and industrial development.

More specifically, it will compare under-researched overtourism-related aspects of solastalgia and environmental change with more mainstream studies focusing on the impact of industrial developments on people’s belonging, relationship and attachment to place. 

The research aims to identify socially sustainable solutions and interventions that reduce environmental damage and avoid the associated health, social and economic costs by adopting a strategic interdisciplinary, participatory and co-creative method. 

It combines collaborative filmmaking and citizen science approaches in the fields of green criminology, biology and psychology to create interdisciplinary communities of academic and community-based researchers identifying, analysing and representing environmental problems and solutions in their own terms.",558919,,,"Bid Development",,Pending,"Ceri Jones (CRJ10),Moya Burns (MLB40),Nick Mai (NM480),Pre-award Admin,Zainab Mai-Bornu (ZMB2)",4,2024-09-01,2028-08-31,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"ESRC ESRC (ECON & SOC RES COUNCIL)","ESRC Default Scheme","Research Councils - ESRC","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"Place-based approaches to sustainable living: outline stage",,https://www.ukri.org/opportunity/place-based-approaches-to-sustainable-living-outline-stage/,,"2023-07-13 16:00",2000000.00,,,,,,"Nick Mai (NM480)","Moya Burns (MLB40),Ceri Jones (CRJ10),Zainab Mai-Bornu (ZMB2)",,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,,,,"SS/CR: Criminology","LS/PY: Clinical Psychology,SS/HP: Politics & International Relation","LS/PY: Clinical Psychology,SS/CR: Criminology,SS/HP: Politics & International Relation","SS/CR: Criminology","LS/PY: Clinical Psychology,SS/HP: Politics & International Relation","LS/PY: Clinical Psychology,SS/CR: Criminology,SS/HP: Politics & International Relation",,,,,,,,,,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.00,,0.00,,0.00,0.00,0,0.00,0,0.00,0,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,,0.00,,0.00,,0.00,0,0.00,0,0.00,0,"2023-05-25 17:51:41",,Private,,"2023-05-25 16:54:59","Nick Mai (NM480)","2023-05-25 17:51"

"Structural studies of misfolded and polymeric alpha1-antitrypsin in ERQC and ERLAD",,"Lay Abstract from LoI: 
Genetic mutations in the gene that encodes the protein alpha1-antitrypsin, such as the so-called Z variant, cause disease (termed alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency, A1ATD) via their effects upon the three-dimensional structure of the protein that determines its function and fate.   After synthesis, the Z variant alpha1-antitrypsin protein folds to the optimal structure inefficiently. This has a number of direct consequences at the molecular level.  A1AT folding occurs in a part of the cell known as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The majority of the protein produced fails to progress beyond ER quality control steps involving other proteins known as PDI and EDEM (that work together to help undo misfolding and signal when there is persistent misfolding).  Protein molecules that fail to fold correctly in this process may be broken down in a process outside the ER known as ER-associated degradation. Alternatively a protein called UGGT1 may recycle misfolded protein for further rounds of attempted refolding (Fig. 2).  However excessive protein misfolding, as for a high abundance protein like A1AT, can predispose to deleterious stress in the cells that have to accommodate it.

A proportion of the Z variant folds with less dramatic structural effects but is still sufficiently destabilised to allow neighbouring A1AT molecules to modify their structure and for each molecule to swap some structural features into equivalent regions of the next.  This links individual A1AT molecules together into a chain or 'polymer' that is harder to remove from the cell than individual misfolded proteins. Accumulation of Z A1AT polymers triggers an  abnormal cellular response.  They can be cleared by a general cell component turnover system known as autophagy, or by a more specific process known as ER-lysosome associated degradation (ERLAD).  Remarkably UGGT1 appears to play a different but important role here too - interacting with polymers to facilitate their movement from the ER into a separate part of the cell (the lysosome) where they are broken down.

We hypothesise that these processes relate to the predisposition to disease in people with Z variant A1AT, and that obtaining a detailed understanding of how polymeric or more poorly-folded species interact with PDI and EDEM, or UGGT1 opens the way to understanding how to increase or reduce these interactions to help treat A1ATD.  We aim to do this using cutting-edge methods to extract the interacting molecules from cells and study them to near atomic detail.  To understand whether each interaction is beneficial or harmful in A1AT-associated liver fibrosis we will study the effects of boosting or reducing levels of PDI, EDEM and UGGT1 on relevant experimental readouts.",490036,,,"Award Setup",,Successful,"Pre-award Admin",2,2023-07-01,2025-06-30,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"ALPHA-1 FOUNDATION Alpha-1 Foundation","ALPHA-1 FOUNDATION Default Scheme","Non EU (Overseas) Based Charities (Open Competition & External Peer Review)","T3 - 20% VAT on Expenditure - not recoverable,Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,,,,,"2023-02-17 23:55",142857.14,"2023-05-16 12:38",,"2024-05-15 00:00",2023-05-16,,"Bibek Gooptu (BG129)",,,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,,"Istituto di biologia e biotecnologia agraria (IBBA)",,"LS: Respiratory Sciences",,"LS: Respiratory Sciences","LS: Respiratory Sciences",,"LS: Respiratory Sciences",,No,,,,"99 - Not Applicable for Institute reporting",,"Janet Harris (JH68)",,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1038294,,,"Not Applicable for HEBCI",,,"2023-02-16 15:47",,,,,,,142702.43,142702.43,319969.39,318639.61,142702.43,142702.43,-175937.18,44.78,1004.62,0.7,-15656.78,-10.97,142702.43,142702.43,0.00,142702.43,0.00,142702.43,141697.81,141697.81,142702.43,142702.43,0.00,142702.43,0.00,142702.43,56714.29,30000.00,5000.00,57800.39,16661.39,36710.10,4428.90,119141.40,0.00,142702.43,142702.43,318639.61,319969.39,142702.43,142702.43,-175937.18,44.78,1004.62,0.7,-15656.78,-10.97,"2023-05-24 09:48:11",,Discoverable,,"2023-02-08 14:06:11","Bibek Gooptu (BG129)","2023-10-12 14:10"

These guidelines, supported by the UK Kidney Association, were developed by experts and researchers in the fields of kidney disease and physical activity. This work has already been cited (included in other medical research articles) 39 times (as of 16/5/2023) showing the widespread impact of this work on other researchers and healthcare professionals. The guidelines make up a significant component of a recent educational programme developed by the Global Renal Exercise Network (GREX) for healthcare professionals.

However, despite being widely circulated across the research community, many people living with kidney disease may not be aware these guidelines exist. Indeed, a recent survey of rehabilitation provisions for kidney disease suggested many renal units are not aware of the guidelines either. 

Guidance from the Chief Medical Officers in the UK on the amount and type of physical activity people should be doing to improve their health can be found on the UK government webpages (https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/physical-activity-guidelines). To help the general population understand this information better, the Department of Health and Social Care have created easy-to-understand infographics for these guidelines. 

Infographics are visual representations of information, data, or knowledge intended to present information quickly and clearly. These infographics support the guidelines and can be shared online, via social media, or printed out as posters and displayed in healthcare settings.

To help promote our UK and kidney-specific physical activity and exercise guidelines to people living with kidney disease, we want to create some visually appealing and informative infographics. We want to create three infographics for each of the stages of kidney disease covered in the guidelines – non-dialysis kidney disease, transplantation, and dialysis.",552765,,,"Bid Awaiting Response",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",1,2023-08-01,2024-07-31,,"RO - Standard Research",Other,,"LEICESTER HOSPITALS Leicester Hospitals Charity","LEICESTER HOSPITALS Default Scheme","UK Charities (Other Process)","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,,,,,,,"2023-05-22 08:23",,"2024-05-21 00:00",,,"Thomas Wilkinson (TJW26)",,,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,,,,"LS/HS: Diabetes",,"LS/HS: Diabetes","LS/HS: Diabetes",,"LS/HS: Diabetes",,,,,,,,"Thomas Barson (TB199)",,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2023-05-22 08:23",,,,,,,2322.00,2322.00,2322.00,2322.00,2322.00,2322.00,0.00,100,0.00,0,0.00,0,2322.00,2322.00,0.00,2322.00,0.00,2322.00,2322.00,2322.00,2322.00,2322.00,0.00,2322.00,0.00,2322.00,2322.00,522.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,2322.00,2322.00,2322.00,2322.00,2322.00,2322.00,0.00,100,0.00,0,0.00,0,"2023-05-22 08:23:59",,Discoverable,,"2023-05-16 12:46:12","Thomas Wilkinson (TJW26)","2023-05-22 08:23"

"NIHR RfPB Courage of Compassion ‘into’ practice: implementation, acceptability and feasibility for nurses and midwives’ psychological wellbeing in the English NHS.",,"Study Title: 
Courage of Compassion ‘into’ practice: implementation, acceptability and feasibility for nurses and midwives’ psychological wellbeing in the English NHS.  
Background:
Psychological wellbeing of the healthcare workforce is critical for staff retention and patient safety; poor workforce wellbeing affects levels of compassion and staff and patient experiences and outcomes (The Kings Fund, 2020). Many interventions designed to support wellbeing target individuals instead of system wide issues, although the latter are known to significantly impact staff experiences and improve wellbeing (Kinman et al, 2020). Individual ‘solutions’ to systemic, organisational issues (e.g., poor working conditions, excessive workload) can actually be more damaging for staff psychological wellbeing (Edwards and Cowper, 2022).  
The Kings Fund published system-level recommendations specifically for nurse and midwife wellbeing in its ‘Courage of Compassion’ report (2020). To date, although Compassionate Leadership (underpinning the report) has been ‘adopted’ by the NHS, no work has been undertaken to understand how these recommendations might effectively be implemented and evaluated in practice. 
Problem formulation:
We will use qualitative methods to a) explore how existing and new wellbeing interventions could help organisations meet The Kings Fund recommendations and b) understand how feasible and acceptable these recommendations / interventions would be to managers, and clinicians in the NHS and policy makers. The findings will inform future research which would seek to implement and evaluate the recommendations in practice.
Project aims:
1.	Identify NHS stakeholder participants
2.	Scope literature and map existing interventions to report recommendations
3.	Identify gaps in existing intervention provision barriers (e.g., system, resource) to meet the report recommendations
4.	Determine stakeholders’ experiences and perceptions of acceptability and feasibility relating to form, content and delivery of interventions identified
5.	Determine the acceptability and feasibility to recipients and deliverers of any proposed interventions 
6.	Synthesise findings (from WP1 and WP2) and align with patient / staff outcome measures (for pathway to impact)
7.	Develop future research (large scale grant / proposal) implementing and evaluating interventions in practice
Methods:
Two acute NHS hospital Trust case studies:
Work Package 1: Development phase (aims 1, 2 and 3) 
Thirty semi-structured interviews and 2 focus groups with key NHS stakeholders (clinicians, managers, policy makers). 
Work Package 2: Acceptability and feasibility phase (aims 4 and 5)
Thirty semi-structured interviews and 1 co-production event with potential intervention recipients and deliverers (clinical and managerial). 
Work Package 3: Synthesis and pathway to impact: (aim 6 and 7)
Synthesise findings (WP1 and 2); make recommendations; develop large mixed methodology grant application and determine pathway to impact.
*The ‘theoretical framework of acceptability’ (Sekhon et al, 2017) will be used in WP1 and WP2 to inform decisions about the form, content, and delivery mode of ‘operationalising’ report recommendations relating to staff wellbeing and on the acceptability of both the proposed intervention content and the means of delivery.

"Towards the understanding of vein graft disease in women.","vein grafts in women","Women undergoing coronary artery bypass grafts (CABG) develop accelerated vein graft disease and experience worse long-term outcomes compared to men for reasons that are unclear. In preliminary work we have demonstrated sex differences in the transcriptional response of venous endothelial cells to arterial shear, a key initiator of vein graft disease. The aim of the current study was to identify specific genes and pathways that lead to accelerated vein graft disease in women with a view to the development of precision therapeutics. 
Methods: Applied informatics analysis will use spatial cell sequencing data from an established ex-vivo model of vein graft disease to identify differentially expressed genes and pathways in males and females. Candidate genes and pathways will be validated using targeted RNA sequencing and protein quantification in an established external bioresource. Potential causality will be determined using causal inference analysis in UK Biobank.",543819,,,"Bid Development",,Pending,"Gavin Murphy (GJM19),Hardeep Aujla (HA200),Mustafa Zakkar (MZ207),Pre-award Admin",3,2023-12-01,2026-05-31,,"RF - Research Fellowship",Research,"Legacy Project","BHF British Heart Foundation","BRITISH HEART Default Scheme","UK Charities (Open Competition & External Peer Review)","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"Research fellwoship",,,,"2023-05-14 10:15",,,,,,,"Mustafa Zakkar (MZ207)","Gavin Murphy (GJM19)","Hardeep Aujla (HA200)","Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,,,,"LS: Cardiovascular Sciences",,"LS: Cardiovascular Sciences","LS: Cardiovascular Sciences",,"LS: Cardiovascular Sciences",,,,,,,,,,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,231751.14,,423281.93,,231751.14,-191530.79,54.75,-720.79,-0.31,-720.79,-0.31,231751.14,231751.14,0.00,231751.14,0.00,231751.14,232471.93,232471.93,231751.14,231751.14,0.00,231751.14,0.00,231751.14,38485.28,23632.00,0.00,48975.00,0.00,43702.50,5272.50,141835.00,0.00,231751.14,,423281.93,,231751.14,,-191530.79,54.75,-720.79,-0.31,-720.79,-0.31,"2023-05-18 14:03:11",,Private,,"2023-04-27 10:13:37","Mustafa Zakkar (MZ207)","2023-05-18 14:07"

"Frailty in European emergency departments",FEED,"Frailty requires different care models and approaches to be considered, and yet its prevalence within emergency care populations remains poorly understood. Similarities and variations between emergency care service users’ age and frailty, and the unscheduled healthcare facilities available to them, have not previously been compared at the European level.

This cross-sectional study will describe the prevalence of frailty and methods for its assessment in European emergency departments. This knowledge will inform population-attuned configuration of healthcare services and education.

A flash mob design will rapidly gather a large volume of data from many sites across Europe. Site co-ordinators will be identified through the European Taskforce on Geriatric Emergency Medicine collaboration and invited to report their system characteristics and services using a structured form. Over a twenty-four-hour period, demographic and outcome data will be collected for all adults attending the participating departments, including age, Clinical Frailty Scale, modes of attendance and departure, first vital signs, and duration of ED visit.

Analysis will compare and contrast local, national, and European epidemiology and immediate emergency care outcomes of ageing and frailty. Service characteristics will be evaluated to identify best practice and to inform policy standardisation and workforce development.",520274,RM62W520274,,"Project Live",Locked,Successful,"James van Oppen (JVO3),Post-award Admin,Pre-award Admin,Tim Coats (TC61)",1,2023-07-01,2023-09-30,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"COLL OF EMERGCY MED The Royal College of Emergency Medicine","COLL OF EMERGCY MED Default Scheme","UK Charities (Open Competition & External Peer Review)","T3 - 20% VAT on Expenditure - not recoverable,Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"Spring 2023 RCEM Research Grants",,https://rcem.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Guide_to_RCEM_Grant_Application_Spring_2023_-v1.3_20102022.pdf,,"2023-03-31 08:00",,"2023-03-27 10:50",,"2024-03-26 00:00",2023-05-03,,"James van Oppen (JVO3)","Tim Coats (TC61)",,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,,,,"LS/HS: Population Health Sciences","LS: Cardiovascular Sciences","LS/HS: Population Health Sciences,LS: Cardiovascular Sciences","LS/HS: Population Health Sciences","LS: Cardiovascular Sciences","LS/HS: Population Health Sciences,LS: Cardiovascular Sciences",,,,,,"99 - Not Applicable for Institute reporting",,"Thomas Barson (TB199)","Jane Bee (JB759)","Post-award Admin (Project Setup)","Post-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Clinical medicine","Grant number: Spring 2023 #4","10 - Automatic payment by Funder - Actual Costs",,,,,"2023-03-17 14:43",,,,,,,2400.00,2400.00,2400.00,2400.00,2400.00,2400.00,0.00,100,0.00,0,0.00,0,2400.00,2400.00,0.00,2400.00,0.00,2400.00,2400.00,2400.00,2400.00,2400.00,0.00,2400.00,0.00,2400.00,2400.00,2400.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,2400.00,2400.00,2400.00,2400.00,2400.00,2400.00,0.00,100,0.00,0,0.00,0,"2023-05-15 16:20:46",,Discoverable,,"2023-03-14 12:15:07","James van Oppen (JVO3)","2023-05-15 16:20"

"Logistics for Bacteria: Spatial-temporal coordination of multiple cell-cell communication systems",,"Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn) is a major human
pathogen and its cell-cell communication systems are key determinants of whether the microbe
colonizes as a harmless commensal or acts as an invasive pathogen. Many studies have focused on
streptococcal cell-cell communication systems, from diverse families, extensively broadening our
understanding of their regulation, machinery and function. However, little is known about temporal
coordination and inter-dependence across families, since they have been studied independently. This
diminishes the understanding of the intricacies of pneumococcal biology occurring due to the emergent
properties conferred by the complex regulatory interactions, and reduces the likelihood of their potential
exploitation as anti-infective targets. We found that the ABC transporter, PptAB, provides a molecular
link between two diverse families of cell-cell signaling systems, the Rgg/SHP and TprA/PhrA systems.
Specifically, PptAB is required to activate signaling from the Rgg/SHP family, and we find that it also
decreases signaling from the TprA/PhrA system. In Aim 1, we will dissect the molecular mechanism by
which PptAB dampened TprA/PhrA signaling. We will investigate the involvement of the Eep
metalloprotease, identify the molecular target of PptAB, and test for binding sites and direct interactions
between PptAB and relevant components of the TprA/PhrA pathway. In Aim 2, we focus on generating
a temporal map of two cell-cell communications systems in vivo and measuring the temporal
progression of each signaling system in vitro using microfluidics to visualize cell signaling at the singlecell level in high-parallel. In Aim 3 we explore how PptAB and the coordination of cell-cell
communication systems influences virulence-associated phenotypes such as capsule levels, biofilm
formation, and adherence to host cells. Our studies will integrate information from two signaling
systems, that represent diverse families of communication systems to establish how these systems are
coordinated both in vitro and in vivo, and the relevance of this coordination to disease processes. The
findings have the potential to provide a framework, in which to overlay current and new knowledge of
signaling pathways, to generate a more integrated view of cell-cell signaling and how its phenotypic

"Understanding the secondary mechanisms by which SGLT2i's influence sarcopenia in those with T2DM",,"Sodium-glucose transport protein 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) have provided a step change in the way in which we treat and manage those with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) through their role in the manipulation of glucose reabsorption. There is also growing evidence for their use in other associated long term conditions (LTCs). As such understanding the wider implications of their use is paramount to inform their use in clinical practice. Loss of skeletal muscle mass and function is common in individuals living with T2DM and other LTCs. SGLT2i have been shown to significantly influence body mass and as such, understanding the link between the use of SGLT2i and skeletal muscle health is vital to ensure appropriate measures are taken when prescribing SGLT2i, in particularly in those at risk from a loss of muscle mass and function. This project will use cutting edge proteomic techniques in order to investigate how SGLT2i's manipulate the systemic and skeletal muscle proteome. Having this understanding will be the first step in developing complex interventions which will look to offset the detrimental effects of SGLT2i's on skeletal muscle health, whilst maintainng the life changing benifits ofr SGLT2i's in those with T2DM.",540186,,,"Bid Approval",Locked,Pending,"HoD CancerStudies,HoDiabetes",2,2024-12-01,2025-12-01,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"DIABETES UK Diabetes UK","DIABETES UK Default Scheme","UK Charities (Open Competition & External Peer Review)","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"Project Grant Call",,https://www.diabetes.org.uk/research/for-researchers/apply-for-a-grant/project-grants,,"2023-12-01 14:50",500000.00,,,,,,"Luke Baker (LAB69)","Melanie Davies (MJD34),Donald Jones (DJLJ1)",,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,,,,"LS: Respiratory Sciences","LS/GG: Cancer Research Centre,LS/HS: Diabetes","LS/GG: Cancer Research Centre,LS/HS: Diabetes,LS: Respiratory Sciences","LS: Respiratory Sciences","LS/GG: Cancer Research Centre,LS/HS: Diabetes","LS/GG: Cancer Research Centre,LS/HS: Diabetes,LS: Respiratory Sciences",,,,,,"99 - Not Applicable for Institute reporting",,"Janet Harris (JH68)",,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,40400.00,,91255.94,,40400.00,-50855.94,44.27,0.00,0,-28513.84,-70.58,40400.00,40400.00,0.00,40400.00,0.00,40400.00,40400.00,40400.00,40400.00,40400.00,0.00,40400.00,0.00,40400.00,40400.00,40400.00,0.00,33789.98,28513.84,4747.48,528.67,17065.95,0.00,40400.00,,91255.94,,40400.00,,-50855.94,44.27,0.00,0,-28513.84,-70.58,"2023-05-10 15:35:54",,Discoverable,,"2023-04-20 14:46:13","Luke Baker (LAB69)","2023-05-11 10:17"

Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant paediatric brain tumour with a third of all patients metastatic at diagnosis. Group3 subtype (G3) predominates in infants and young children and has the lowest survival rate. Current standard-of-care treatment is multi-modal and highly aggressive, leaving young survivors with severe long-term cognitive dysfunction, growth impairments, and secondary malignancies. The advancement of G3 therapies for improved treatment solutions has been restricted by the paucity of appropriate cell models that recapitulate G3 microenvironment and the ability to understand the molecular composition defining G3 cellular architecture that result in varied treatment efficiency.

"Super-resolution microscopy approaches to understand gene regulation in early female human development",,"The 46th chromosome in XX female mammals, the second X, has to be switched off. That way females equalize their gene expression dosage with males, who have an X and a Y chromosome. X-inactivation is a fascinating mechanism of whole chromosome silencing which initiates during early embryonic development and is maintained for life in somatic tissues thereafter. Female embryos do not survive without inactivating the X, while the importance of robust regulation of X-inactivation is evident by over 500 X-linked diseases, including severe female-bias to immune diseases due to the richness of immune-related genes on the X. 

In the mouse, I showed that X-inactivation progresses by changes in diffraction-limited ribonucleoprotein assemblies. While mouse models are very useful to elucidate basic principles of mammalian gene regulation, there are critical differences to humans, including gestation length and the timing of X-inactivation. Therefore studying X-inactivation in human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) or induced hPSCs reprogrammed from somatic cells is essential to understand fundamental gene-regulatory events of early human development. Naïve and primed hPSCs correspond to pre- and post-implantation, a time of human development we know very little about and when X-inactivation occurs. With this project I aim at developing for the first time single-cell quantitative super-resolution microscopy investigations to study the configuration and epigenetic changes occurring to the inactivating X in humans using hPSCs as model systems. These studies will offer an unprecedented view to gene-regulatory events occurring during this critical timepoint that will increase our understanding of peri-implantation in humans, which is when most pregnancies are terminated.",545169,,,"Bid Awaiting Response",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",2,2023-09-15,2024-09-15,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"ROYAL SOCIETY The Royal Society","Research Grants","Research Councils (BEIS) - Roy Society and Brit Academy","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"Research grants",,https://royalsociety.org/grants-schemes-awards/grants/research-grants/,,"2023-05-10 23:30",70000.00,"2023-05-10 09:18",,"2024-05-09 00:00",,,"Yolanda Markaki (GM365)",,,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,,,,"LS: Molecular & Cell Biology",,"LS: Molecular & Cell Biology","LS: Molecular & Cell Biology",,"LS: Molecular & Cell Biology",,No,,,,,,"Yusuf Dedat (YD134)",,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2023-05-09 09:53",,,,,,,66890.00,66890.00,69941.21,69941.21,66890.00,66890.00,-3051.21,95.64,0.00,0,-1520.49,-2.27,66890.00,66890.00,0.00,66890.00,0.00,66890.00,66890.00,66890.00,66890.00,66890.00,0.00,66890.00,0.00,66890.00,66890.00,34440.00,31100.00,1913.38,1520.49,350.59,42.30,1137.83,0.00,66890.00,66890.00,69941.21,69941.21,66890.00,66890.00,-3051.21,95.64,0.00,0,-1520.49,-2.27,"2023-05-10 09:18:31",,Discoverable,,"2023-05-01 23:29:38","Yolanda Markaki (GM365)","2023-05-10 09:18"
"Characterising kinase-dependent and -independent functions of PRPF4B",,"Genes are essential players in the process of life as they contain the information needed for the production of proteins, which act as the cell’s workhorse. Genes do not directly produce proteins as they are first expressed into RNA molecules, which are in turn translated into proteins. In humans, each RNA molecule producing proteins require a preliminary removal of major portions of the RNA molecule, a process known as RNA splicing, before the subsequent correct translation into proteins. RNA splicing is a highly complex process requiring the coordination of numerous RNA molecules and proteins. While the players involved in RNA splicing are becoming well-known, it is far less clear how these players are regulated and how RNA splicing is coordinated with other processes, such as transcription which is the mechanism producing an RNA molecule from a gene. I am proposing to investigate the functions of a protein, called PRPF4B, which is involved in RNA splicing and, in a less known manner, in other cellular processes. Importantly, PRPF4B has been found to be critical for cell migration and metastasis formation in breast cancers.

"New vaccine technology for inducing robust mucosal immunity",,"There is a consensus that a mucosal vaccine would be highly beneficial against many infectious diseases, including TB, Covid-19 and dengue, with large proportion of human population already  having some, but sub-optimal immunity from prior exposure or vaccination. A mucosal vaccine has the potential to boost the overall immunity levels (systemic and mucosal) but importantly also to induce faster-acting immunity at the site of pathogenic challenge (i.e., TB and SARS-CoV2). However, mucosal vaccination has its own challenges and despite a sustained interest over many decades, only a few mucosal vaccines have ever been approved, and mostly involving live attenuated organisms. Subunit vaccine approach, while conventionally the most attractive, faces the challenge of the paucity of adjuvants suitable for mucosal application. The major aim of the proposed study is therefore to address that challenge by circumventing the use of exogenous adjuvants altogether, in a mucosal vaccine.

We developed a proof-of-concept approach that is based on molecular engineering of adjuvanticity in a vaccine, and specifically intended for mucosal vaccination. Our new vaccine technology is based on a single polypeptide that incorporates, alongside the antigen of interest, two molecular adjuvants, that is, the cholera toxin non-toxic B subunit and the Immunoglobulin G Fc fragment. The first is a well-known mucosal immunomodulator while the second facilitates vaccine uptake by infiltrating antigen-presenting cells (APC), resulting in robust vaccine-induced mucosal immunity. We have preliminarily tested this vaccine technology and obtained strongly promising results but now need to test this concept in pathogen-specific animal models of infection and with human tissues. Therefore, the main objective of this proposal is to test the protective potential and the mechanisms involved of this vaccine technology to move it to next level (TLR5) of readiness (with PCT application already in place). Our vaccines will be tested in the mouse models of TB, dengue and SARS-CoV2 infection, in which we will model mucosal boosting in hosts that have some pre-existing but insufficient systemic immunity. We will then specifically study the mechanisms of mucosally-induced protective immunity, including virus-neutralising potential of mucosal antibodies (SARS-CoV2, dengue) and capacity of lung tissue resident B and T cells to confer improved protection, by passive transfer to naïve hosts. We will also validate immunogenicity of our vaccines using sera and blood cells from pathogen exposed or vaccinated human hosts. The outcomes of this study will then demonstrate the feasibility of this new vaccine technology to be translated towards human application, as a boost vaccine against these and possibly other pathogens.
Objectives of the current study

The overall aim of the study is to advance our new vaccine technology from the current proof of concept stage to late pre-clinical phase, by validating it in the relevant animal models of infection and with human tissues. The 'PCF' technology is designed for mucosal application and intended as an adjuvant-free boost vaccination approach in hosts with pre-existing but insufficiently protective systemic or mucosal immunity. We will therefore model this in animals and determine the capacity of our vaccines to raise the immunity levels overall, and most specifically in the respiratory tissues, i.e. the lungs. The important objective in this study will therefore be to identify the protective immune mechanisms following mucosal vaccination and establish the role for humoral of cellular immune components (i.e. tissue resident cells) in dedicated passive-transfer animal experiments. Three infectious diseases (TB, dengue, and Covid-19) will be focused on as the initial exemplifications of the utility of this new vaccine technology to induce robust mucosal immunity, with further applications envisaged following a successful demonstration.
To test the PCF vaccine technology, we have set up the following specific objectives: 

1.	To test in mice the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of the novel PCF vaccine delivery platform, using TB, dengue and SARS-CoV2 as examples
2.	To test mucosal and systemic antibodies neutralising potential (dengue, SARS-CoV2) in vitro and evaluate the role of lung BRM and TRM in protective immunity (dengue, 
        SARS-CoV2 and TB) by passive transfer in mice
3.	To test vaccine immunoreactivity in human PBMC and sera of TB, dengue or SARS-CoV2 exposed individuals

We believe that by achieving these objectives we will have demonstrated the vaccine potential of our technology to be translated toward human phase of research and

"Aural Diversity: Transdisciplinary Transformations",AD:TT,"Aural Diversity is an inherently transdisciplinary idea that can only exist across, above and beyond hearing-related disciplines. It arises from the apparently simple observation that everybody hears differently. However, disciplinary fields concerned with hearing are generally founded on a tacit assumption of “otological normalcy’, that we all possess undifferentiated pairs of ears. We may well ask: whose ears are standard? whose ear has primacy? A fuller discussion of Aural Diversity may be found at http://auraldiversity.org where an infographic sets out the field’s scope.

"Gaming AI inspired design of durable omniphobic surface morphologies (SurfGame)",SurfGame,"Durable omniphobic anti-fouling morphologies are of great importance for their broad applications e.g. anti-fouling coatings will maintain high power output of solar panels, and greatly reduce energy consumptions and CO2 emission due to marine fouling in shipping industry. To achieve the best anti-fouling performance, the major competition is to design durable omniphobic morphologies to repel liquids with lower and lower surface tensions. The challenge is: morphology design is a highly complex and open-ended question with few clues to follow, hence it requires comprehensive and multidisciplinary techniques to manufacture designed morphologies in micro and nano scale. This project will develop a conceptually new methodology in designing omniphobic morphologies via inspiration of winning a video game (SurfGame). We will exploit deep reinforcement learning AI techniques to simulate the biological evolution of omniphobic morphologies (self-trained AI player) and validate SurfGame predictions in the real world to develop mechanically durable surface morphologies that repel liquids with the lowest surface tensions.

ESTABLISH,ESTABLISH,"ESTAbLIsh – Endovascular versus Surgical Treatment for Acute Limb Ischaemia 

Background to the research: 
One in five people above 55 years have narrowings or blockages in their leg arteries. A sudden blockage of the leg arteries is called acute limb ischaemia. This is a serious emergency. Without good blood supply, the leg will not receive oxygen, with the nerves, muscles, and skin eventually dying. If blood supply is not restored, the artery blockage can lead to amputation or death. Leg artery blockages are the most common cause of amputation in the NHS, impacting  greatly on people’s quality of life and the NHS health services. 
 
In people  with a sudden blockage of the leg arteries, urgent treatment is required to prevent amputation or. The usual treatment involves blood thinning medications and a surgical operation. The operation requires an incision to the skin (cut) to open the artery and trawl out the blockage. For some people, this surgical operation can be too invasive for their overall health and recovery. Keyhole artery procedures have now been developed, which can be used instead of the open surgical operation to unblock arteries. These keyhole procedures can be done without a general anaesthetic and do not require big skin incisions. The keyhole procedures are now routinely available in the NHS and used for some patients. However, no one has compared the open surgery to the keyhole procedure. This creates uncertainty for the patients and healthcare professionals. It might also be leading to more amputations, deaths, and higher costs to the NHS and taxpayer.

Aim of the research: 
The aim of this research is to compare keyhole procedures to unblock leg arteries head-to-head with open surgery, the usual treatment. We will look at which procedure (keyhole or open surgery) is best at preventing amputation and death in those with a sudden leg artery blockage, the two things that these people told us mattered the most to them when we were designing this research. 

Design  and methods used: 
People with a sudden loss of blood supply to the leg will be invited to take part. They will be randomly (by chance) offered open surgery or a keyhole procedure to see if the keyhole procedure can match the open surgery in terms of preventing amputation and death. People who take part will be followed-up for two years. We will also compare quality of life between the two groups, complications, and costs of people’s NHS care.

Patient and Public involvement:
Hundreds of patients and NHS staff took part in a national survey in 2021 to find out which are the most important research questions for people with blocked leg arteries. This study addresses many of these questions, such as “how can we improve results in people with artery blockages, who need surgery?”.  The study was designed with the help and feedback of people with artery diseases, who shaped the design of the research and our key questions. Two patients will be formal members of the research team. They will develop study documents and take part in all meetings. An independent patient advisory group will also meet every six months to advise the research team. 

Dissemination:
This will be the first study to compare keyhole procedures to open surgery in this setting, leading to a change in how these people are treated. We will share findings with both lay and expert audiences, with the support of our patient team members. We will prepare plain English summaries (including videos, and graphics) of our findings during the study and when it is completed. These will be shared with patients and via social as well as traditional media and a study website. Final results will be published in medical journals, shared at conferences, and sent to all relevant healthcare and NHS societies.",535366,,,"Bid Awaiting Response",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",6,2024-09-01,2029-11-30,,"RC - Research Clinical Trial",Research,,"NIHR National Institute of Health Research","NIHR Default Scheme","UK Central Government","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"NIHR HTA Researcher Led",,https://www.nihr.ac.uk/documents/hta-researcher-led-open-call-specification-document/21993,,"2023-05-03 08:25",2000000.00,"2023-04-26 14:45",,"2024-04-25 00:00",,,"Athanasios Saratzis (AS875)",,,"Only people involved in this project",,"University of Newcastle-upon-Tyne",Yes,,,,,"LS: Cardiovascular Sciences",,"LS: Cardiovascular Sciences","LS: Cardiovascular Sciences",,"LS: Cardiovascular Sciences",,Yes,,,,"99 - Not Applicable for Institute reporting",,"Kerry Warner (KW153)",,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Clinical medicine",,,,,,,"2023-04-24 09:52",,,,,,"Co-chief investigator for external NIHR HTA project, led by Newcastle University and Aberdeen Clinical Trials Unit.",72221.79,98135.17,90277.24,122668.96,90277.24,122668.96,-24533.79,80,96935.17,98.78,13628.21,13.89,1200.00,122668.96,0.00,122668.96,0.00,122668.96,1200.00,1200.00,1200.00,122668.96,0.00,122668.96,0.00,122668.96,1200.00,0.00,0.00,93101.96,83306.96,8740.50,1054.50,28367.00,0.00,98135.17,72221.79,122668.96,90277.24,122668.96,90277.24,-24533.79,80,96935.17,98.78,13628.21,13.89,"2023-04-28 10:29:29",,Discoverable,,"2023-04-11 08:22:00","Athanasios Saratzis (AS875)","2023-04-28 10:38"

"Identifying species-specific genetic markers in gibbons",,"Some gibbon species are difficult to distinguish phenotypically, especially infants and juveniles, and some are able to produce viable hybrid offspring. This poses significant challenges for the management of captive gibbons. In the context of conservation breeding programmes, cryptic hybrids and incorrectly identified individuals threaten the genetic integrity of breeding populations. In rescue centres in species range countries, uncertainty of the provenance of individuals hinders release efforts. The ability to reliably genetically identify gibbon species would greatly aid conservation efforts, and the management and welfare of these endangered animals in captivity. With a panel of species-specific markers, testing of individuals, using non-invasively collected samples (hair, faeces) can be performed with simple PCR and gel electrophoresis technology. This makes the approach cost-effective and accessible to stakeholders (zoos, conservation organisations) with only basic molecular biological laboratory facilities. A key research area of my PhD thesis was to identify species-specific L1 insertions for this purpose. This work demonstrated proof-of-concept, and that species-specific L1 insertions are present in gibbons. These findings were independently validated by our collaborator, Dr Kazunari Matsudaira, on samples held at the University of Tokyo.

We are now preparing a research grant proposal to continue and expand upon this work, in order to identify markers in as many species as possible. This project will involve collaborators in numerous countries, including the USA, Australia, Germany, Japan, and also gibbon range countries.

Upon completion, the marker panel will provide a cost-effective tool for zoos to establish the genetic background of the animals in their collections. For centres in range countries, this will fulfil an urgent need to confidently identify species and hybrids, in order to make appropriate decisions regarding pairing, breeding, and release of rescued animals. This will significantly contribute to the conservation management of gibbons, both in- and ex-situ.",531954,,,"Bid Awaiting Response",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",3,2024-02-01,2027-01-31,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"BBSRC BBSRC BIOTECH.& BIOLOG.SCIENCE","BBSRC Default Scheme","Research Councils - BBSRC","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"Standard Research Proposal Responsive Mode",,https://www.ukri.org/opportunity/bbsrc-standard-research-grant/,,"2023-04-26 04:00",2000000.00,"2023-04-25 14:38",,"2024-04-24 00:00",,,"Richard Badge (RMB19)","Lauren Lansdowne (LEL13)",,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,,,,"LS: Genetics & Genome Biology",,"LS: Genetics & Genome Biology","LS: Genetics & Genome Biology",,"LS: Genetics & Genome Biology",,No,,,,"99 - Not Applicable for Institute reporting",,"Yelena Mazulina (YM41)",,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2023-04-21 18:31",,,,,,,555312.24,555312.24,712716.45,712716.45,694140.30,694140.30,-157404.22,77.91,123619.43,22.26,94464.98,17.01,415593.16,694140.30,0.00,694140.30,0.00,694140.30,431692.80,431692.80,415593.16,694140.30,0.00,694140.30,0.00,694140.30,243206.56,121257.24,21437.82,93801.45,29154.45,57687.30,6959.70,187222.20,0.00,555312.24,555312.24,712716.45,712716.45,694140.30,694140.30,-157404.22,77.91,123619.43,22.26,94464.98,17.01,"2023-04-25 14:38:38",,Discoverable,,"2023-03-30 11:27:33","Richard Badge (RMB19)","2023-04-25 16:06"

"Introversion, Identity and Rights: Is there no Right to be Quiet?",,"The so-called ‘Quiet revolution’ spearheaded by the writer Susan Cain drew public attention to a value system that Cain labels an ‘extravert ideal’. It is estimated that introverts make up at least one third of society but are disadvantaged by a society that discriminates against those who fail to live up to this ideal. Drawing upon psychological and legal theory, this project will be the first to investigate how human rights law engages with the personality trait of introversion and determine whether there is an extravert ideal also embedded within the law.",531596,,,"Bid Awaiting Response",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",3,2024-09-01,2027-08-31,,"RF - Research Fellowship",Research,,"THE LEVERHULME TRUST The Leverhulme Trust","THE LEVERHULME TRUST Default Scheme","UK Charities (Open Competition & External Peer Review)","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"Major Research Fellowship",,https://www.leverhulme.ac.uk/major-research-fellowships,,"2023-05-12 16:00",,"2023-04-20 16:40",,"2024-04-19 00:00",,,"Liz Wicks (EAW19)",,,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,,,,"SS/LL: Law",,"SS/LL: Law","SS/LL: Law",,"SS/LL: Law",,,,,,,,"Ellen Puurman (EP258)",,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2023-04-18 13:43",,,,,,,196100.66,196100.66,705819.52,705819.52,196100.66,196100.66,-509718.86,27.78,-23239.03,-11.85,-356061.26,-181.57,196100.66,196100.66,0.00,196100.66,0.00,196100.66,219339.68,219339.68,196100.66,196100.66,0.00,196100.66,0.00,196100.66,1950.00,0.00,0.00,350318.23,332822.23,17496.00,0.00,136161.60,0.00,196100.66,196100.66,705819.52,705819.52,196100.66,196100.66,-509718.86,27.78,-23239.03,-11.85,-356061.26,-181.57,"2023-04-20 16:40:18",,Discoverable,,"2023-03-29 16:10:39","Liz Wicks (EAW19)","2023-04-20 16:40"
"WP2.3 Bridging Spaces of Exception - Experimentations in New Approaches to Solidarity, Representation and Resistance",,"This WP (work package of an ESRC Research Centre bid) studies experimentation in the organisation of workers who exist at the boundaries of in-work-poverty. Regulatory and policy enclosures, along with changes in the labour process, have created workplaces as ‘spaces of exception’, where employer discretion dictates conditions and workers may be isolated by employer-landlord networks, low wages, poor conditions and limited access to remedy. In researching such workplaces, the challenge is to understand how, by what means, and to what extent, the commoning of nascent solidarities can emerge, so that ‘hope can become possible’ for workers.

The popularity of social media provides an opportunity to create a broadcast series informing the general public and other stakeholders of the background to electrification. The aim of this FUSE proposal is to train an undergraduate student how to script and make podcasts. It will train them in the general areas of what batteries are, how they are made and recycled and what are the latest developments in the field. They will get very good transferrable skills and clear outputs with at least 6 podcasts. It will provide the Faraday Institution with a good communication tool and allow us to bring in experts from around the project as well as international contributions.

"Beyond RNA polymerase II kinases: phosphatases in transcription, transcription-associated processes, and development",,"Transcription of eukaryotic protein-coding genes is coupled to co-transcriptional processes, including mRNA capping, pre-mRNA splicing, mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation. Transcription also causes the formation of R-loops, RNA/DNA hybrids that are associated with DNA damage if left unresolved. Phosphorylation of the RNA polymerase II carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) plays a critical role in the coordination of transcription with these critical processes. The role of specific kinases in transcription, including CDK7 or P-TEFb, are well studied. In contrast, the mechanism of phosphatases in transcription are much less well understood and represent a major unanswered question in the field. Furthermore, phosphatases active in transcription are frequently dysregulated in cancer, participating in aberrant gene expression programs, and could represent important therapeutic targets. We will use interdisciplinary cutting-edge approaches, including targeted protein degradation, genomics, and (phospho-)proteomics to determine the targets and functions of phosphatases in transcription, pre-mRNA splicing, and R-loop biology. Several phosphatases involved in transcription, including Ctdp1, Ctdspl2, and Ssu72, are essential for mouse development. We will generate mouse embryonic organoids to understand which cellular pathways these phosphatases participate in during development. Altogether, this work will lead to a significant shift in our understanding of phosphatases functions in transcription and development.",497599,,,"Bid Awaiting Response",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",9,2024-01-01,2032-12-31,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"WELLCOME TRUST Wellcome Trust","WELLCOME TRUST Default Scheme","UK Charities (Open Competition & External Peer Review)","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"Wellcome Career Development Awards",,https://wellcome.org/grant-funding/schemes/career-development-awards#key-dates-e35c,,"2023-04-04 17:00",,"2023-04-03 14:44",,"2024-04-02 00:00",,,"Michael Tellier (MT477)",,,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,,,,"LS: Molecular & Cell Biology",,"LS: Molecular & Cell Biology","LS: Molecular & Cell Biology",,"LS: Molecular & Cell Biology",,No,,,,,,"Yusuf Dedat (YD134)",,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2023-03-29 15:56",,,,,,,1952348.20,1952348.20,3667517.08,3667517.08,1952348.20,1952348.20,-1715168.88,53.23,-200302.88,-10.26,-200302.88,-10.26,1887638.20,1952348.20,0.00,1952348.20,0.00,1952348.20,2152651.08,2152651.08,1887638.20,1952348.20,0.00,1952348.20,0.00,1952348.20,630724.72,476635.30,105389.42,436920.00,0.00,332139.00,40071.00,1077946.00,0.00,1952348.20,1952348.20,3667517.08,3667517.08,1952348.20,1952348.20,-1715168.88,53.23,-200302.88,-10.26,-200302.88,-10.26,"2023-04-03 14:44:35",,Discoverable,,"2023-02-15 11:29:06","Michael Tellier (MT477)","2023-04-03 14:44"

"Genetic prediction of common diseases in African populations",,"It is becoming increasingly feasible to use a person’s DNA sequence to predict their risk of developing diseases such as diabetes and heart disease.  However most research to date has been conducted in European ancestry populations, and studies in other populations, particularly those of African ancestry, have been less encouraging.  In order to address this discrepancy, it is necessary to both increase the amount of research data available from African populations, and to understand and address the fundamental reasons why results from European ancestry do not translate well to the African setting.

This project will use newly collected data from thousands of people in several African countries including Uganda, Malawi, South Africa and Nigeria.  We will evaluate risk predictors developed in European ancestries across different African populations to understand the factors driving their accuracy, with a focus on cardiovascular traits and kidney disease.  We will explore the use of predictors developed from African diaspora, especially African Americans, and compare their usefulness between different African populations.  We will develop and apply methods to combine information across multiple ancestries to obtain prediction models with global relevance.  In so doing we will establish prospects and guidelines for achieving equitable applications of genetic risk prediction.",531401,,,"Bid Development",,Pending,"Frank Dudbridge (FD98),Pre-award Admin",5,2022-09-26,2026-09-27,,"TS - Studentship",Studentship,,"WELLCOME TRUST Wellcome Trust",,"UK Charities (Open Competition & External Peer Review)","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Frank Dudbridge (FD98)",,,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,,,,"LS/HS: Population Health Sciences",,"LS/HS: Population Health Sciences","LS/HS: Population Health Sciences",,"LS/HS: Population Health Sciences",,,,,,,,,,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Studentship for Brenda Udosen in the Doctoral Training Programme for Genomic Epidemiology and Public Health Genomics",,0.00,,0.00,,0.00,0.00,0,0.00,0,0.00,0,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,,0.00,,0.00,,0.00,0,0.00,0,0.00,0,"2023-03-29 14:10:23",,Private,,"2023-03-29 14:06:49","Frank Dudbridge (FD98)","2023-03-29 14:11"

The analysis will attempt to reveal the areas of strength and weakness in the datasets to help inform the Client’s written TEF submission and drive the narrative.
Leicester will obtain the base dataset from the OfS website. The data processing and transformation software, Alteryx, will be used to reshape and calculate information on student outcome and experience. The data will then be exported to Excel for final presentation. The analysis will attempt to reveal the difference between the actual performance and expected benchmark for each metric split. The difference will then be translated into a likely TEF rating based on the OfS technical specification and rules around statistical certainty. In the final presentation of the data the volume of students impacted by each split will be provided to assess relative risk and weighting of the various metrics.

I hope you are well. I will reply to your recent email separately.
 
Just so that you are aware, the EPSRC will transition from Je-S to a new Funding Service after 30 March 2023. See:
·        https://www.ukri.org/apply-for-funding/improving-your-funding-experience/using-the-new-ukri-funding-service-for-applicants/
https://www.ukri.org/apply-for-funding/improving-your-funding-experience/council-transition-to-the-new-the-funding-service/council-transition-to-the-new-funding-service-epsrc/
 
The following Responsive mode funding opportunities are transitioning for this date (Group 1):
EPSRC standard research grant
EPSRC new investigator award (NIA)
EPSRC overseas travel grant
EPSRC network grant
EPSRC discipline-hopping in information and communications technologies
EPSRC working with overseas scientists
 
Group 1 will form part of a group of opportunities known as ‘responsive mode’ in the Funding Service.
 
Je-S will be closed to new applications on 30 March 2023 for:
group 1 opportunities
strategic equipment outline applications
fellowship applications
 
IF YOU ARE APLYING TO THESE SCHEMES YOU WONT BE ABLE TO SUBMIT BEWEEN MARCH AND MAY.
 
·        UKRI must receive your application on Je-S by 30 March 2023 4:00pm UK time
·        You will not be able to apply after this time until the opportunity reopens on the Funding Service in May 2023.
 
The new FS will be more streamlined for bids compared to JeS. EPSRC will launch its ‘always open’ opportunities on the Funding Service as rounds with closing dates, and the format of a bid will likely change quite a lot. Most importantly, if you have started a bid in JeS before 30th March, you may not be able to migrate the information to the new FS system.
 
Given you are almost ready to submit and have gone through peer review, I would advise that you please try to submit your NIA application as soon as possible and ideally before 30th March. I’ve spoken to Simon Gill and Bo Chen and they agree with this approach.
 
Please continue to follow internal processes for submission, and give yourself enough time for your proposal to pass through UoLeicester’s Je-S submission route before this date.
 
Additional notes for EPSRC
 
The Funding Service rounds for group 1 opportunities will run consecutively. This means that applicants may continue to apply at a time that suits them.
We will publish timelines at least 8 weeks in advance of reopening on the Funding Service for:
mathematical sciences small grants
programme grants
strategic equipment
Between 30 March 2023 and May 2023, applicants will not be able to submit applications for group 1 opportunities or fellowships. Pre-announcements with application details for after the switchover to the Funding Service will be released via the funding finder during this period to continue to allow applicants to work on their proposals.

"COMMA: Conservative and Optimised Mesh-free Modelling of Aerodynamics",COMMA,"Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) has become a basic and essential tool supporting broad scientific and engineering areas. It has unlocked enormous technical and economic advantages over the past decades. Improved CFD capabilities are critical for the UK to meet current and upcoming major challenges including the energy crisis, green aviation, and Net Zero 2050. However, our current CFD capabilities struggle to handle these complex challenges, mainly due to restrictions of the strong mesh dependency. 

Modern CFD's strong mesh dependency is a significant bottleneck in the workflow. It restricts CFD’s ability to handle complex problems, and engineering applications such as human sneezing are often considerably simplified for meshing feasibility. The meshing process also requires intensive user interactions and is a major source of uncertainty. In industrial applications, e.g., novel aircraft designs, it is common that more than 70% of the overall analysis time would be spent on manually creating and adjusting meshes. Therefore, reducing CFD’s mesh dependency is important and urgent to prepare us with more reliable, flexible, and automated modelling capabilities, to enable timely and innovative research and applications to meet upcoming challenges.  

Combining the PI’s unique background in advanced CFD methods, adjoint formulations, and meshing, this project proposes research on advanced mesh-free CFD methods integrated with adjoint-based error estimation and optimisation. This challenging idea can effectively reduce the mesh dependency in the numerical schemes and deliver case-optimised modelling results at reduced cost, time, and difficulty. Relevant research on this novel idea is scarce in the UK and abroad. The key outcome of this project is a series of methodology innovations amounting to a novel mesh-free CFD workflow, capable of case-optimised modelling at drastically reduced mesh dependency, costs, and difficulty. 

This project addresses forefront research challenges in the EPSRC topics of Fluid Mechanics and Numerical Analysis. This project first proposes an innovative multi-level virtual geometry concept to address the lack of flow conservation in current mesh-free schemes. The novel Automatic Differentiation (AD) techniques will be adopted to derive and implement the adjoint form of complex and discrete systems. The enabled adjoint-based error analysis will further improve our understanding of mesh-free schemes. Finally, the developed mesh-free schemes and adjoint forms will be integrated through gradient-based optimisation methods for case-optimised modelling. 

This research will help maintain the UK excellence in Fluid Mechanics and CFD and will transform our current CFD capability leading to further economic/technical advantages. By engaging actively with the UK Vertical Lift Network, the advanced modelling capabilities of the mesh-free CFD workflow of this project will be demonstrated with practical and complex rotor/turbine designs to support the emerging Urban Air Mobility (UAM) industry. Wider scientific and engineering applications will be extended to broad disciplines including aerospace, renewable energy, and environment through planned impact activities in the UK and globally. The outcomes of this project are planned to be progressively published in top-quality journals and disseminated in well-received workshops/conferences to key academic/industrial beneficiaries.",490218,,,"Bid Awaiting Response",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",2,2023-09-01,2025-08-31,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"EPSRC EPSRC ENG.& PHYS.SCIENCES R C","EPSRC Default Scheme","Research Councils - EPSRC","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"EPSRC New Investigator Award",,https://www.ukri.org/councils/epsrc/guidance-for-applicants/types-of-funding-we-offer/new-investigator-award/#contents-list,,,,"2023-03-24 18:17",,"2024-03-23 00:00",,,"Tao Zhang (TZ77)",,,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,,,,"SE/EN: Aero' & Computational Engineering",,"SE/EN: Aero' & Computational Engineering","SE/EN: Aero' & Computational Engineering",,"SE/EN: Aero' & Computational Engineering",,,,,,"99 - Not Applicable for Institute reporting",,,,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2023-03-24 09:13",,,,,,,270638.03,270638.03,346217.15,346217.15,338297.54,338297.54,-75579.12,78.17,135623.12,50.11,107598.48,39.76,128623.98,338297.54,0.00,338297.54,0.00,338297.54,135014.92,135014.92,128623.98,338297.54,0.00,338297.54,0.00,338297.54,18150.00,7200.00,0.00,75040.64,28024.64,41954.40,5061.60,136161.60,0.00,270638.03,270638.03,346217.15,346217.15,338297.54,338297.54,-75579.12,78.17,135623.12,50.11,107598.48,39.76,"2023-03-24 18:17:13",,Discoverable,,"2023-02-08 16:02:24","Tao Zhang (TZ77)","2023-03-24 18:17"

"Are transcriptional kinases and phosphatases also involved in pre-mRNA splicing?",,"Production of mature mRNAs in eukaryotes requires both transcription by RNA polymerase II and RNA processing, including mRNA capping, pre-mRNA splicing, and mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation. Removal of introns by the spliceosome is a highly coordinated process based on RNA-RNA, RNA-protein, and protein-protein interactions. Protein phosphorylation has been found to play important roles in regulating RNA-protein and protein-protein interactions of splicing factors and the activity and of the spliceosome. Protein phosphorylation also regulates RNA polymerase II transcription and is mediated by several kinases, including cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)7, CDK9, and CDK12, and protein phosphatase (PP)1 and PP2A. Interestingly, several of these kinases and phosphatases have been found to (de)phosphorylate splicing factors but it remains unclear whether pre-mRNA splicing is affected because of the transcriptional defects associated with the inhibition of these kinases and phosphatases. To overcome this hurdle, I am proposing to use an approach combining an in vitro transcribed but unspliced transcript and nuclear extracts treated or not with kinase or phosphatase inhibitors. The use of an in vitro transcribed transcript will bypass the issue of transcriptional defects associated with the inhibition of these kinases and phosphatases and will allow their characterisation in pre-mRNA splicing. As pre-mRNA splicing and several kinases and phosphatases involved in transcription are frequently co-dysregulated in cancer, this project will provide important insights for future research.",522676,,,"Bid Awaiting Response",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",1,2023-07-01,2024-06-30,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"BIOCHEMICAL SOCIETY Biochemical Society","BIOCHEMICAL SOCIETY Default Scheme","UK Charities (Open Competition & External Peer Review)","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"Eric Reid Fund for Methodology",,https://www.biochemistry.org/grants-and-awards/grants-and-bursaries/eric-reid-fund-for-methodology/,,"2023-03-21 23:55",4000.00,"2023-03-21 09:39",,"2024-03-20 00:00",,,"Michael Tellier (MT477)",,,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,,,,"LS: Molecular & Cell Biology",,"LS: Molecular & Cell Biology","LS: Molecular & Cell Biology",,"LS: Molecular & Cell Biology",,No,,,,,,"Yusuf Dedat (YD134)",,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2023-03-17 14:16",,,,,,,3957.00,3957.00,3957.00,3957.00,3957.00,3957.00,0.00,100,0.00,0,0.00,0,3957.00,3957.00,0.00,3957.00,0.00,3957.00,3957.00,3957.00,3957.00,3957.00,0.00,3957.00,0.00,3957.00,3957.00,3957.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,3957.00,3957.00,3957.00,3957.00,3957.00,3957.00,0.00,100,0.00,0,0.00,0,"2023-03-21 09:39:48",,Discoverable,,"2023-03-16 15:14:16","Michael Tellier (MT477)","2023-03-21 09:39"
"WEarable Biomarker and ACcelerometery Unit – WEBACU: a development project  - EPSRC",WEBACU,"Tendon and Joint pain are the two most common lower limb disorders impacting the nation. Management of these conditions is through physical activity and exercise, however we know that many people fail rehab and 1 in 5 still have pain 10 years later.  Rehabilitation fails due to poor adherence, commonly related to increased pain. Clinicians and Patients need to be able to monitor and adjust rehabilitation in light of individual responses. 
Our Ambition is to improve rehabilitation adherence and success, through the development of a wearable (smart patch) sensor capable of providing real time feedback related to relevant biomarkers associated with pain and physical activity from individual patients to clinical staff.
The project will utilise 3 work packages, WP1 will be an experimental study using commercial accelerometers to ascertain which lower limb anatomical sites are suitable for measuring physical activity levels BUT importantly link to common sites for tendon or joint pain. WP2 is a scoping review to determine which biomarkers have been identified and the anatomical site they have been identified. WP3 is a patient, public and stakeholder series of workshops in order to determine the acceptability of wearing such a device and to understand the core requirements of such a device. 
The project comprises of three work packages that will be used to develop knowledge required for a larger EPSRC grant submission. These projects are critical to the long term ambition of the work group and the project directly came from the RTN event in January 2023.",514562,,,"Bid Awaiting Response",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",1,2023-09-01,2024-01-31,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"EPSRC EPSRC ENG.& PHYS.SCIENCES R C","EPSRC Default Scheme","Research Councils - EPSRC","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"Feasibility funding Call",,https://www.rehabtechnologies.net/feasibilityfunding,,"2023-03-20 12:45",50000.00,"2023-03-20 16:29",,"2024-03-19 00:00",,,"Seth O'Neill (SO59)",,"Vicki Inchley (VLC2),Rachael Hyams (RBH12)","Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,"Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust",,,"LS/AH: Physiotherapy",,"LS/AH: Physiotherapy","LS/AH: Physiotherapy",,"LS/AH: Physiotherapy",,Yes,,,,"99 - Not Applicable for Institute reporting",,"Vicki Inchley (VLC2)",,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2023-03-20 12:53",,,,,,"This is a joint project with collabs from Loughborough University and Nottingham NHS trust",37222.97,37222.97,47249.52,47249.52,46528.71,46528.71,-10026.55,78.78,18957.39,50.93,15363.45,41.27,17668.24,46528.71,0.00,46528.71,0.00,46528.71,18265.58,18265.58,17668.24,46528.71,0.00,46528.71,0.00,46528.71,1060.00,360.00,0.00,7708.69,3593.94,2733.75,0.00,21275.25,0.00,36118.17,36118.17,45868.52,45868.52,45147.71,45147.71,-9750.35,78.74,17852.59,49.43,14258.65,39.48,"2023-03-20 16:29:49",,Discoverable,,"2023-03-07 12:41:43","Seth O'Neill (SO59)","2023-03-20 16:29"

"Causal discovery and Machine Learning based analysis of wearable sensor data for people with breathlessness",,"The project will employ causal discovery and machine learning techniques on data derived from the Respeck sensor worn by patients with Long Covid or COPD to measure continuously (at 1­minute
resolution) respiratory rate/effort, and the intensity and type of physical activity in ongoing observational studies in Leicester. 
There are in the UK alone over 1.5 million people living with Long Covid, with over one ­half experiencing a limitation in their day ­to day acti­vities. For other long term conditions, programmes of
rehabilitation, with exercise as a core component, are clinically cost­effective. Exercise is very challenging for people with Long Covid and there are concerns that it is harmful in some people because of post-exertional symptom exacerbation (PECE). Breathlessness is a highly prevalent and distressing symptom for people with Long Covid and a common symptom of PESE alongside fatigue and brain-fog. The underlying mechanisms of PESE are unknown and under-­researched despite it being a common symptom experienced by people with Myalgic encephalomyelitis/Chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). 
Using the Respeck device, we will investigate the relationship between prior physical activity and PESE (using a symptom tracker on the device) underpinned by a biological objective measure of quiet tidal breathing. We will assess the relationship over days and weeks. The results would directly inform pacing regimes by understanding how much physical activity and rest is required to avoid PESE. 
Exacerbations and hospital admissions are a major healthcare cost to the NHS with over 160,000 hospitalisations for COPD patients per annum. The RCP/BTS national audit highlights a hospital
admission from COPD is associated with a 45% readmission rate and 12% mortality at 3 months. Population studies in COPD have suggested that by the second hospitalisation patients are on a
significant downward trajectory of repeated exacerbations. Patients with COPD frequently report disabling breathlessness and it is hard for patients and GPs to distinguish day­to­day variability in symptoms from an exacerbation requiring treatment with medication ­ this is particularly difficult post-hospitalisation. Repeated course of antibiotics and steroids have negative side ­effects. Understanding
whether there is a change in tidal breathing at rest may help reduce unnecessary treatments or enable
earlier intervention. 
We will investigate the relationship between physical activity, symptoms and a biological objective measurement of tidal breathing using the Respeck device. Patients will be recruited as part of an existing observational study at Leicester BRC.",518183,,,"Bid Submission",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",2,2023-10-01,2025-03-31,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"UKRI UK Research and Innovation UKRI","UKRI Default Scheme","Research Councils - UKRI","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,https://www.ukri.org/opportunity/artificial-intelligence-innovation-to-accelerate-health-research/,,,,"2023-03-28 15:15",750000.00,,,,,,"Rachael Evans (RE66)","Neil Greening (NJG27),Mark Orme (MWO4),Gillian Doe (GED6)",,"Only people involved in this project",,"UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH",Yes,,,,,"LS: Respiratory Sciences",,"LS: Respiratory Sciences","LS: Respiratory Sciences",,"LS: Respiratory Sciences",,,,,,,,,,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2023-03-13 13:05",,,,,,,,260858.24,,330933.86,,326072.80,-70075.62,78.82,160197.92,61.41,90204.78,34.58,96795.01,326072.80,0.00,326072.80,0.00,326072.80,100660.32,100660.32,96795.01,326072.80,0.00,326072.80,0.00,326072.80,23500.00,5000.00,0.00,111132.14,69993.14,36710.10,4428.90,119141.40,0.00,260858.24,,330933.86,,326072.80,,-70075.62,78.82,160197.92,61.41,90204.78,34.58,"2023-03-13 13:05:45",,Discoverable,,"2023-03-10 15:09:39","Rachael Evans (RE66)","2023-03-13 14:41"

"Blueprinting AI for Science at Exascale - Phase II (BASE-II)",BASE-II,"The purpose of this funding is to fund a PDRA/RSE position at Leicester to deliver work package 2 of the EPSRC-funded ExCALIBUR project ""BASE-II"".

The funds have been awarded to STFC-RAL and will be transferred from there to Leicester.  

The full description of the project (taken from the objectives section of the associated JeS form) is: 
The main objectives of this proposal, underpinned by various scoping activities in Phase I (BASE-I), in decreasing order of priority, are:

* Develop a software suite and designs for supporting exascale computing from the AI point of view - (hence blueprinting AI for Science at Exascale).
* Ensure that the software stack and relevant designs cover the challenges around five of the key areas of AI, identified as part of Phase I, namely, AI Benchmarking, AI in HPC, hardware-software co-design, learning from large-scale datasets, and tools, frameworks, and workflows.
* Collaborate with a number of communities, such as, academia, scientific disciplines, industries, and public sector research establishments (PSREs, such as, national laboratories), for accommodating their steer and inputs, not only to ensure that the resulting stack addresses the challenges stated above, but also remains highly relevant to various communities. 
* Actively engage with other ExCALIBUR funded cross cutting projects to ensure relevant developments from those projects are enhanced, integrated, and leveraged within our project to ensure better functionality and completeness. 
* Support the knowledge exchange activities of other ExCALIBUR funded projects.
* Engage with relevant international projects (e.g., Exascale Computing Project in the US) to ensure that international communities work together in the development of exascale software solutions and for better knowledge exchange.
* Ensure that the program overcomes the barriers and exploits the opportunities for knowledge exchange across a range of target groups and communities, including different scientific domains, research software engineering, AI communities, academia, PSREs, international organisations and industries.

"Targeted bacteriophage metagenomics",,"Bacteriophages are the most abundant biological entities on the planet with 1031 in the biosphere. They drive the evolution of their bacterial hosts by mediating horizontal gene transfer, facilitating the spread of antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes. Despite being abundant, we have only begun to understand their diversity through culture-independent methods (eg viral metagenomics). Although viral metagenomics has expanded our understanding of phage diversity, critically it does not link the bacteriophage with its host. The range of hosts a bacteriophage can infect is traditionally based on the use of plaque assays that allows the visualisation of a plaque, should the infection result in a productive infection. However, there are many issues with this method. 1) if the bacteriophage is temperate in nature, it may not produce plaques. 2) the bacteriophage may be able to attach and inject its DNA (also transferring genes) but not be able to actively replicate due to host anti-phage systems. Thus, traditional plaque assays do not allow to determine the full host range of bacteriophages and viral metagenomics does not link bacteriophages to their hosts.
In this work, we will assess if mini-cells of bacteria could be used to selectively separate host-specific phages from complex natural bacteriophage communities. Mini-cells are ""mini"" bacterial cells that are produced as a result of the asymmetric division of min mutant strains. They contain no chromosomal DNA but crucially contain membrane receptors for bacteriophage attachment. We hypothesise that it is possible to infect mini-cells with only host-specific bacteriophages from an environment. Utilising metagenomics to sequence only the viral DNA contained within minicells. Thus, enabling direct linking of bacteriophages to their hosts. The approach would revolutionise our understanding of bacteriophage-host interactions, by allowing for the first time high-throughput identification of which bacteriophages can infect a particular host.
Proposed work:
Objective 1: Produce mini-cells of E. coli and Vibrio natriegens
Objective 2:  Test and optimise with a defined cocktail of bacteriophages, with known host ranges, the limits of detection of mini-cells combined with metagenomics to identify host specific interactions.
Objective 3: Apply the use of mini-cells to produce host specific metagenomes from sewage or animal slurries (E. coli) and aquaculture (Vibrio)
Objective 4: Apply the use of mini-cells to identify the extent to which phages mediate horizontal gene transfer
Potential Impact: Unlike traditional viral metagenomics, this research offers the crucial ability to directly link bacteriophages with the hosts they can infect. Furthermore, it will provide a high-throughput way to identify the extent to which bacteriophages can mediate the horizontal transfer of genes. The successful completion of this project will result in the development of a novel methodology enabling to assess and study host-specific phage metagenomes, substantially increasing research capacity of scientists working on bacteriophage biology, microbiome, antimicrobial resistance, horizontal gene transfer. Thus, this project has the clear potential to transform our understanding of microbial life and therefore it is fully aligned with the BBSRC’s priority area ‘Frontier bioscience: understanding the rules of life’.",507582,,,"Bid Awaiting Response",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",2,2023-09-01,2024-10-31,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"BBSRC BBSRC BIOTECH.& BIOLOG.SCIENCE","BBSRC Default Scheme","Research Councils - BBSRC","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"Pioneer awards: early-stage frontier bioscience research",,https://www.ukri.org/opportunity/pioneer-awards-early-stage-frontier-bioscience-research/,,"2023-03-14 16:00",200000.00,"2023-03-09 17:04",,"2024-03-08 00:00",,,"Edouard Galyov (EG98)","Andrew Millard (ADM39)",,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,,,,"LS: Genetics & Genome Biology",,"LS: Genetics & Genome Biology","LS: Genetics & Genome Biology",,"LS: Genetics & Genome Biology",,No,,,,"99 - Not Applicable for Institute reporting",,"Yelena Mazulina (YM41)",,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2023-02-28 11:46",,,,,,"This is the second stage application.

"Insect-inspired stereoscopic visual information processing for accurate collision detection (MANTIS)",MANTIS,"Stereoscopic vision is critical for autonomous robots, autonomous vehicles and many other autonomous mobile machines, however it is still a huge technical challenge to the current technology. On the other hand, invertebrates with tiny brains such as praying mantis, its stereo vision uses a fundamentally different computational algorithm compared to vertebrate stereopsis – it focuses on luminance changes rather than comparing luminance in the two eyes directly. This strategy makes it computationally efficient and robust to poor image resolution against complex backgrounds, and even outperforms humans at judging stereoscopic distances. With a significantly less number of neurons involved in invertebrate stereopsis compared to vertebrates, it could be an ideal model for constructing new stereopsis algorithms that excel in efficiency, reliability and convenience for miniaturisation.

Inspired by insect stereopsis, this consortium proposes an innovative stereoscopic vision system for robots to accurately locate and handle household items timely. It aims to build computational models utilising the mechanisms underlying the insect stereoscopic vision, test the algorithms with robots for catching physical moving objects, and explore the optimal realisation and miniaturisation methods for massive production. Fulfil this aim demands multidisciplinary expertise in neurobiology, computer science, circuit design and robotics. This breadth of expertise is not readily possessed within one institution. The market potential of the new stereoscopic system could not be well exploited, unless by dedicated partners from industry. This consortium is designed to bring together leading neurobiologists, neural system modellers, chip designers, robotics researchers and engineers from Europe, the East of Asia and South America to complement each other’s strengths via staff secondments, jointly organised workshops and conferences. The European partners will build up strong expertise and market leadership in this emerging area.  


Six work packages (WPs) are designed to achieve the objectives of the project: 

WP1: Visual information processing models inspired by insects’ stereopsis for depth perception
WP2: Implementation of stereopsis algorithms to robotics systems for collision detection
WP3: Optimal hardware realisation and miniaturisation
WP4: System integration, verification and demonstration

"OPTimising FORest management decisions for a low-carbon, climate resilient future in EUrope",OptFor-EU,"Significant reductions in anthropogenic emissions and increases in CO2 sinks are needed to meet the 1.5 centigrades threshold for
global warming set out in the Paris Agreement and reach the climate-neutrality goal of the European Green Deal by 2050. The CO2
sink provided by forests, including old-growth forests, partially offsets the rise in anthropogenic CO2 emissions, providing a largescale
buffer to climate change. Depending on their characteristics and local circumstances, such as management practices or
ecosystem services, forests may range from net CO2 sinks to sources. The project 'OPTimising FORest management decisions for a
low-carbon, climate resilient future in Europe (OptFor-EU)' will build a Decision Support System (DSS) to provide forest managers and
other relevant stakeholders with tailored options for optimising decarbonisation and other Forest Ecosystem Services (FES) across
Europe. Based on exploitation of existing data sources, use of novel Essential Forest Mitigation Indicators and relationships between
climate drivers, forest responses and ecosystem services, OptFor-EU has five specific objectives: (1) Provide an improved
characterisation of the Forest-Climate Nexus and FES; (2) Utilise end-user focused process modelling; (3) Empower forest end-users to
make informed decisions to enhance forest resilience and decarbonisation; (4) Provide a novel DSS service; and (5) Bridging different
EU strategic priorities, robust science, and stakeholders in the forest and forest-based sectors. Based on a supply-demand approach,
the methodology combines an iterative process of data consolidation, modelling, and co-development of solutions alongside forest
managers and other practice stakeholders in all European Forest Types. The DSS will be designed and tested at 8 case study areas, to
provide a ready-to-use service, near to operational (TRL7) at European level, while a user adoption and up-take plan will maximise the societal and business impact.",475356,RP18W475356,,"Project Live",Locked,Successful,"Darren Ghent (DJG20),Post-award Admin,Pre-award Admin",4,2023-01-01,2026-12-31,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"IFS HEG Innovate UK - Horizon Europe Guarantee","IFS HEG Default Scheme","EU Government Bodies (inc European Commission but not UK)","T3 - 20% VAT on Expenditure - not recoverable,Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,HORIZON-CL6-2021-CLIMATE-01,,,,,,"2021-12-13 10:25",,"2023-02-01 00:00",2023-01-29,,"Darren Ghent (DJG20)",,,"Only people involved in this project",,"NATIONAL ADMINISTRATION OF METEOROLOGY Romania",Yes,,,,,"SE/PA: National Centre for Earth Obs'",,"SE/PA: National Centre for Earth Obs'","SE/PA: National Centre for Earth Obs'",,"SE/PA: National Centre for Earth Obs'",,No,,,,"99 - Not Applicable for Institute reporting",,"Sue Atkinson (SAM45)","Viral Patel (VP186)","Post-award Admin (Project Setup)","Post-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,Physics,101060554,"12 - Claim to be submitted - Actual Costs",,"Not Applicable for HEBCI","Not applicable for HEBCI",,"2023-01-29 10:27",,,,,,"RP18G0106-44986-GHENT:

The project will engage Subject-Matter Experts and -if possible- public communities (e.g. F&R services at Leicester, local companies on location-based monitoring technology for tracking plumes and other stakeholders as guided by NFCC) to elicit insights as to what emerging risk ‘missing data’ is that is necessary to build more robust and more ‘holistic’ risk models.

"Understanding how digital minimalism reproduces social inequality",,"Digital access has long been viewed as a field in which social inequality is reproduced, for example, the gap between the upper and the lower SES has been widened by the ‘digital divide’ of unequal access to modern information and communications technology (Bonfadelli, 2002). However, this may have changed in today’s society in which digital communications technology is prevalent despite its negative effects (LaRose et al., 2014). Thus, social inequality may be reproduced less by the capability to access digital technology and more by the capability and resources to limit such access. For example, restricting smartphone usage has been argued as an efficient way to improve child social mobility in the UK (12 March 2022, The Guardian). The proposed project will use mixed methods to (1) develop validated measurements to empirically examine digital minimalism and its downstreat effects, and (2) investigate how SES-based (dis)advantages are reproduced in digital minimalism.",475909,,,"Bid Awaiting Response",Locked,Pending,"Pre-award Admin",1,2023-03-31,2023-09-30,,"RO - Standard Research",Research,,"BRITISH ACADEMY The British Academy","BRITISH ACADEMY Default Scheme","Research Councils (BEIS) - Roy Society and Brit Academy","Y6 Income - Outside the Scope",,,"Policy Insight Case Studies 2022-23",,,,,,"2023-02-01 11:10",,"2024-02-01 00:00",,,"Wei-Fen Chen (WC129)",,,"Only people involved in this project",,,Yes,,,,,"SS/BU: M'ing, Innov', Str'gy & Ops, Dept",,"SS/BU: M'ing, Innov', Str'gy & Ops, Dept","SS/BU: M'ing, Innov', Str'gy & Ops, Dept",,"SS/BU: M'ing, Innov', Str'gy & Ops, Dept",,,,,,,,,,"Pre-award Admin (Bid Development)","Pre-award Admin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2023-01-31 16:33",,,,,,,24991.96,24991.96,24991.96,24991.96,24991.96,24991.96,0.00,100,0.00,0,0.00,0,24991.96,24991.96,0.00,24991.96,0.00,24991.96,24991.96,24991.96,24991.96,24991.96,0.00,24991.96,0.00,24991.96,14600.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,24991.96,24991.96,24991.96,24991.96,24991.96,24991.96,0.00,100,0.00,0,0.00,0,"2023-02-01 11:10:22",,Private,,"2023-01-30 14:21:46","Wei-Fen Chen (WC129)","2023-02-01 11:11"
