The initial goals were (1) to propose a new allergic rhinitis classification, (2) to promote the concept of multi-morbidity in asthma and rhinitis and (3) to develop guidelines with all stakeholders that could be used globally for all countries and populations. ARIA - disseminated and implemented in over 70 countries globally - is now focusing on the implementation of emerging technologies for individualized and predictive medicine. MASK [MACVIA (Contre les Maladies Chroniques pour un Vieillissement Actif)-ARIA Sentinel NetworK] uses mobile technology to develop care pathways for the management of rhinitis and asthma by a multi-disciplinary group and by patients themselves. An app (Android and iOS) is available in 20 countries and 15 languages. It uses a visual analogue scale to assess symptom control and work productivity as well as a clinical decision support system. It is associated with an inter-operable tablet for physicians and other health care professionals. The scaling up strategy uses the recommendations of the European Innovation Partnership on Active and Healthy Ageing. The aim of the novel ARIA approach is to provide an active and healthy life to rhinitis sufferers, whatever their age, sex or socio-economic status, in order to reduce health and social inequalities incurred by the disease.   \n2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  We propose a type system for a calculus of contracting processes. Processes can establish sessions by stipulating contracts, and then can interact either by keeping the promises made, or not. Type safety guarantees that a typeable process is honest — that is, it abides by the contracts it has stipulated in all possible contexts, even in presence of dishonest adversaries. Type inference is decidable, and it allows to safely approximate the honesty of processes using either synchronous or asynchronous communication.   \n3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 We report the first experimental observation of negatively charged hydrogen and deuterium cluster ions, Hn- and Dn-, where n≥5. These anions are formed by an electron addition to liquid helium nanodroplets doped with molecular hydrogen or deuterium. The ions are stable for at least the lifetime of the experiment, which is several tens of microseconds. Only anions with odd values of n are detected, and some specific ions show anomalously high abundances. The sizes of these \"magic number\" ions suggest an icosahedral framework of H2 (D2) molecules in solvent shells around a central H- (D-) ion. The first three shells, which contain a total of 44 H2 or D2 molecules, appear to be solidlike, but thereafter a more liquidlike arrangement of the H2 (D2) molecules is adopted.   \n4     Marine stratiform clouds are a challenging target for spaceborne radars due to their proximity to Earth’s surface, limited vertical extent, and low radar reflectivity. The joint European-Japanese Earth Clouds, Aerosol and Radiation Explorer (EarthCARE) mission is scheduled for launch in 2019 and features the first atmospheric Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR) with Doppler capability in space. Here the performance of the CPR in (i) detecting these clouds and their boundaries and (ii) measuring the Doppler velocities of drizzle particles is evaluated. Extensive observations from the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Mobile Facility in marine stratus regimes are used as input to an EarthCARE CPR simulator and to compare the resulting reflectivity factors, Doppler velocities, and cloud detections. Cloud detection of the CPR is 70-80% that of the ground-based radars, depending upon integration length and feature mask configuration. For clouds entirely contained within the surface clutter, detection is limited but is predicted to be an order of magnitude greater for the EarthCARE CPR than for CloudSat due to the improved range sampling rate of the former. The EarthCARE-CPR range resolution is found to introduce cloud top height and reflectivity biases of +100m (equal to the range sampling rate) and +1.3 dB; by applying a constrained linear inversion to the range resolution, these are reduced to 30m and 0.1 dB, respectively. The analysis indicates that a velocity uncertainty of 0.5 ms-1 is achievable through either a 5 km along-track integration or a combination of matched spatial filters and 1 km along-track integration.   \n...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ...   \n2333   Newly collected decapod material from the Cap de Naze Formation (middle-upper Maastrichtian), Senegal, allows description of a new species of Costacopluma (Brachyura: Retroplumidae), which is older than Costacopluma senegalensis (Remy in Gorodiski & Remy, 1959) from the Paleocene of Senegal and documents that the genus survived the end Cretaceous event in the same area. The holotype of Costacopluma mamethioupamei n. sp. is preserved both in dorsal and ventral aspects, and it bears a strange dumbbell-shaped \"scar\" on sternite 4 which is tentatively interpreted as a true epibiont mark or remain, which encrusted the crab cuticle syn- vivo or post- mortem; the identification of the tracemaker is obscured. The cuticular microstructure of Costacopluma mamethioupamei n. sp. is documented using SEM imaging. The cuticle appears to be preserved in its entirety and areas with damaged cuticle shows several distinct layers interpreted as endocuticle, exocuticle and epicuticle. Thanks to the present report of Costacopluma mamethioupamei n. sp. it is now clear that the genus survived the K/Pg boundary not only in the area of the Gulf of Mexico (as documented by several previously published reports) but also in the present-day Senegal. From the palaeobiogeographic perspective, it is interesting to note, that the African continent has been inhabited only with narrow-ridged species of Costacopluma, including Costacopluma concava Collins & Morris, 1975, C. senegalensis and C. mamethioupamei n. sp. This lineage may finally lead to the origin of Tethyan retroplumids, which were widely distributed across Europe during the Eocene.   \n2334                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  None   \n2335                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Children between 5 and 8. years of age freely intervened on a three-variable causal system, with their task being to discover whether it was a common cause structure or one of two causal chains. From 6 or 7. years of age, children were able to use information from their interventions to correctly disambiguate the structure of a causal chain. We used a Bayesian model to examine children's interventions on the system; this showed that with development children became more efficient in producing the interventions needed to disambiguate the causal structure and that the quality of interventions, as measured by their informativeness, improved developmentally. The latter measure was a significant predictor of children's correct inferences about the causal structure. A second experiment showed that levels of performance were not reduced in a task where children did not select and carry out interventions themselves, indicating no advantage for self-directed learning. However, children's performance was not related to intervention quality in these circumstances, suggesting that children learn in a different way when they carry out interventions themselves.   \n2336                                                                                                                    One of the main sources of inspiration for techniques applicable to complex search space and optimisation problems is nature. This paper introduces a new metaheuristic—Dispersive Flies Optimisation (DFO)—whose inspiration is beckoned from the swarming behaviour of flies over food sources in nature. The simplicity of the algorithm facilitates the analysis of its behaviour. A series of experimental trials confirms the promising performance of the optimiser over a set of benchmarks, as well as its competitiveness when compared against three other wellknown population based algorithms. The convergence-independent diversity of DFO algorithm makes it a potentially suitable candidate for dynamically changing environment. In addition to diversity, the performance of the newly introduced algorithm is investigated using the three performance measures of accuracy, efficiency and reliability and its outperformance is demonstrated in the paper. Then the proposed swarm intelligence algorithm is used as a tool to identify microcalcifications on the mammographs. This algorithm is adapted for this particular purpose and its performance is investigated by running the agents of the swarm intelligence algorithm on sample mammographs whose status have been determined by the experts. Two modes of the algorithms are introduced in the paper, each providing the clinicians with a different set of outputs, highlighting the areas of interest where more attention should be given by those in charge of the care of the patients.   \n2337                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Countryside agencies such as the Countryside Council for Wales (CCW) are responsible for reporting on and monitoring the rural environment. The CCW is increasingly being asked to monitor the landscape pressures and effects relating to a series of drivers such as agri-environmental impacts, climate change, and changes to structural support for farmers. Countryside agencies would like to be able to describe the landscape under a range of different policy initiatives. These include the traditional environmental roles relating to land cover habitats (e.g., Annex 1, Priority Habitats), but increasingly relate to new questions. Each of these has their own set of constructs within which the landscape is viewed.   \n\n                                                                                                                  authkeywords   \n0                                                                                                                         None  \\\n1                                                        AIRWAYS ICPs | ARIA | EIP on AHA | ICT | Mobile technology | Rhinitis   \n2                                                                   Contract-oriented computing | Session types | Verification   \n3                                                                                                                         None   \n4                                                                                                                         None   \n...                                                                                                                        ...   \n2333                                    Cuticle microstructure | Decapoda | K/Pg boundary | Palaeobiogeography | Retroplumidae   \n2334                                                                                                                      None   \n2335  Active learning | Bayesian modelling | Causal learning | Causal structure | Scientific learning | Self directed learning   \n2336                                     Dispersive flies optimisation | Mammographs | Medical imaging | Multi-agent algorithm   \n2337                                                                                                                      None   \n\n     citedby_count openaccess     freetoread freetoreadLabel fund_acr   \n0                9          0           None            None     None  \\\n1              118          1   repositoryam           Green      FP7   \n2                8          1   repositoryam           Green      FP7   \n3               25          0  repositoryvor           Green      FWF   \n4               15          0  repositoryvor           Green     NASA   \n...            ...        ...            ...             ...      ...   \n2333             8          0           None            None     APVV   \n2334             0          0           None            None     None   \n2335            39          1  repositoryvor           Green     ESRC   \n2336            12          0   repositoryam           Green     None   \n2337             1          0           None            None     None   \n\n           fund_no                                   fund_sponsor  \n0        undefined                                           None  \n1           261357                    Seventh Framework Programme  \n2           295261                    Seventh Framework Programme  \n3             I978                          Austrian Science Fund  \n4       nceo020006  National Aeronautics and Space Administration  \n...            ...                                            ...  \n2333  APVV-0436-12           Agentúra na Podporu Výskumu a Vývoja  \n2334     undefined                                           None  \n2335  ES/G030634/1           Economic and Social Research Council  \n2336     undefined                                           None  \n2337     undefined                                           None  \n\n[2338 rows x 36 columns]",

The initial goals were (1) to propose a new allergic rhinitis classification, (2) to promote the concept of multi-morbidity in asthma and rhinitis and (3) to develop guidelines with all stakeholders that could be used globally for all countries and populations. ARIA - disseminated and implemented in over 70 countries globally - is now focusing on the implementation of emerging technologies for individualized and predictive medicine. MASK [MACVIA (Contre les Maladies Chroniques pour un Vieillissement Actif)-ARIA Sentinel NetworK] uses mobile technology to develop care pathways for the management of rhinitis and asthma by a multi-disciplinary group and by patients themselves. An app (Android and iOS) is available in 20 countries and 15 languages. It uses a visual analogue scale to assess symptom control and work productivity as well as a clinical decision support system. It is associated with an inter-operable tablet for physicians and other health care professionals. The scaling up strategy uses the recommendations of the European Innovation Partnership on Active and Healthy Ageing. The aim of the novel ARIA approach is to provide an active and healthy life to rhinitis sufferers, whatever their age, sex or socio-economic status, in order to reduce health and social inequalities incurred by the disease.</td>\n      <td>AIRWAYS ICPs | ARIA | EIP on AHA | ICT | Mobile technology | Rhinitis</td>\n      <td>118</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>repositoryam</td>\n      <td>Green</td>\n      <td>FP7</td>\n      <td>261357</td>\n      <td>Seventh Framework Programme</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>2-s2.0-85015904524</td>\n      <td>10.2168/LMCS-12(4:7)2016</td>\n      <td>None</td>\n      <td>None</td>\n      <td>Honesty by typing</td>\n      <td>ar</td>\n      <td>Article</td>\n      <td>Bartoletti M.</td>\n      <td>60033125;60032259;60015986;60015150</td>\n      <td>University of Leicester;Università degli Studi di Cagliari;Università di Trento;Imperial College London</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>None</td>\n      <td>We propose a type system for a calculus of contracting processes.

The joint European-Japanese Earth Clouds, Aerosol and Radiation Explorer (EarthCARE) mission is scheduled for launch in 2019 and features the first atmospheric Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR) with Doppler capability in space. Here the performance of the CPR in (i) detecting these clouds and their boundaries and (ii) measuring the Doppler velocities of drizzle particles is evaluated. Extensive observations from the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Mobile Facility in marine stratus regimes are used as input to an EarthCARE CPR simulator and to compare the resulting reflectivity factors, Doppler velocities, and cloud detections. Cloud detection of the CPR is 70-80% that of the ground-based radars, depending upon integration length and feature mask configuration. For clouds entirely contained within the surface clutter, detection is limited but is predicted to be an order of magnitude greater for the EarthCARE CPR than for CloudSat due to the improved range sampling rate of the former. The EarthCARE-CPR range resolution is found to introduce cloud top height and reflectivity biases of +100m (equal to the range sampling rate) and +1.3 dB; by applying a constrained linear inversion to the range resolution, these are reduced to 30m and 0.1 dB, respectively. The analysis indicates that a velocity uncertainty of 0.5 ms-1 is achievable through either a 5 km along-track integration or a combination of matched spatial filters and 1 km along-track integration.</td>\n      <td>None</td>\n      <td>15</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>repositoryvor</td>\n      <td>Green</td>\n      <td>NASA</td>\n      <td>nceo020006</td>\n      <td>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>...</th>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2333</th>\n      <td>2-s2.0-84941286999</td>\n      <td>10.1016/j.cretres.2015.08.010</td>\n      <td>S0195667115300537</td>\n      <td>None</td>\n      <td>Costacopluma (Decapoda: Brachyura: Retroplumidae) from the Maastrichtian and Paleocene of Senegal: A survivor of K/Pg events</td>\n      <td>ar</td>\n      <td>Article</td>\n      <td>Hyžný M.</td>\n      <td>60071540;60033125;60028311;60023578;60020292;60001987</td>\n      <td>Universite Cheikh Anta Diop;University of Leicester;Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle;Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1;Naturhistorisches Museum, Vienna;Univerzita Komenského v Bratislave</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>142-156</td>\n      <td>Newly collected decapod material from the Cap de Naze Formation (middle-upper Maastrichtian), Senegal, allows description of a new species of Costacopluma (Brachyura: Retroplumidae), which is older than Costacopluma senegalensis (Remy in Gorodiski &amp; Remy, 1959) from the Paleocene of Senegal and documents that the genus survived the end Cretaceous event in the same area. The holotype of Costacopluma mamethioupamei n. sp. is preserved both in dorsal and ventral aspects, and it bears a strange dumbbell-shaped \"scar\" on sternite 4 which is tentatively interpreted as a true epibiont mark or remain, which encrusted the crab cuticle syn- vivo or post- mortem; the identification of the tracemaker is obscured. The cuticular microstructure of Costacopluma mamethioupamei n. sp. is documented using SEM imaging. The cuticle appears to be preserved in its entirety and areas with damaged cuticle shows several distinct layers interpreted as endocuticle, exocuticle and epicuticle. Thanks to the present report of Costacopluma mamethioupamei n. sp. it is now clear that the genus survived the K/Pg boundary not only in the area of the Gulf of Mexico (as documented by several previously published reports) but also in the present-day Senegal. From the palaeobiogeographic perspective, it is interesting to note, that the African continent has been inhabited only with narrow-ridged species of Costacopluma, including Costacopluma concava Collins &amp; Morris, 1975, C. senegalensis and C. mamethioupamei n. sp. This lineage may finally lead to the origin of Tethyan retroplumids, which were widely distributed across Europe during the Eocene.</td>\n      <td>Cuticle microstructure | Decapoda | K/Pg boundary | Palaeobiogeography | Retroplumidae</td>\n      <td>8</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>None</td>\n      <td>None</td>\n      <td>APVV</td>\n      <td>APVV-0436-12</td>\n      <td>Agentúra na Podporu Výskumu a Vývoja</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2334</th>\n      <td>2-s2.0-84940899446</td>\n      <td>10.1016/j.chb.2015.06.041</td>\n      <td>S0747563215004811</td>\n      <td>None</td>\n      <td>Editorial for the CHB special issue on MMOGs</td>\n      <td>ed</td>\n      <td>Editorial</td>\n      <td>Christou G.</td>\n      <td>60104630;60077474;60033125;60025063;60002146</td>\n      <td>European University Cyprus;Cyprus University of Technology;University of Leicester;KU Leuven;Ontario Tech University</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>515-516</td>\n      <td>None</td>\n      <td>None</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>None</td>\n      <td>None</td>\n      <td>None</td>\n      <td>undefined</td>\n      <td>None</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2335</th>\n      <td>2-s2.0-84939599954</td>\n      <td>10.1016/j.jecp.2015.06.017</td>\n      <td>S0022096515001642</td>\n      <td>26298433</td>\n      <td>Children's use of interventions to learn causal structure</td>\n      <td>ar</td>\n      <td>Article</td>\n      <td>McCormack T.</td>\n      <td>60033125;60029738;60022148</td>\n      <td>University of Leicester;Queen's University Belfast;University College London</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>1-22</td>\n      <td>Children between 5 and 8. years of age freely intervened on a three-variable causal system, with their task being to discover whether it was a common cause structure or one of two causal chains. From 6 or 7. years of age, children were able to use information from their interventions to correctly disambiguate the structure of a causal chain. We used a Bayesian model to examine children's interventions on the system; this showed that with development children became more efficient in producing the interventions needed to disambiguate the causal structure and that the quality of interventions, as measured by their informativeness, improved developmentally. The latter measure was a significant predictor of children's correct inferences about the causal structure. A second experiment showed that levels of performance were not reduced in a task where children did not select and carry out interventions themselves, indicating no advantage for self-directed learning. However, children's performance was not related to intervention quality in these circumstances, suggesting that children learn in a different way when they carry out interventions themselves.</td>\n      <td>Active learning | Bayesian modelling | Causal learning | Causal structure | Scientific learning | Self directed learning</td>\n      <td>39</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>repositoryvor</td>\n      <td>Green</td>\n      <td>ESRC</td>\n      <td>ES/G030634/1</td>\n      <td>Economic and Social Research Council</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2336</th>\n      <td>2-s2.0-84938099940</td>\n      <td>10.1007/978-3-319-21133-6_11</td>\n      <td>None</td>\n      <td>None</td>\n      <td>Dispersive flies optimisation and medical imaging</td>\n      <td>ar</td>\n      <td>Article</td>\n      <td>al-Rifaie M.M.</td>\n      <td>60171766;60010964</td>\n      <td>College of Life Sciences;Goldsmiths, University of London</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>183-203</td>\n      <td>One of the main sources of inspiration for techniques applicable to complex search space and optimisation problems is nature. This paper introduces a new metaheuristic—Dispersive Flies Optimisation (DFO)—whose inspiration is beckoned from the swarming behaviour of flies over food sources in nature. The simplicity of the algorithm facilitates the analysis of its behaviour. A series of experimental trials confirms the promising performance of the optimiser over a set of benchmarks, as well as its competitiveness when compared against three other wellknown population based algorithms. The convergence-independent diversity of DFO algorithm makes it a potentially suitable candidate for dynamically changing environment. In addition to diversity, the performance of the newly introduced algorithm is investigated using the three performance measures of accuracy, efficiency and reliability and its outperformance is demonstrated in the paper. Then the proposed swarm intelligence algorithm is used as a tool to identify microcalcifications on the mammographs. This algorithm is adapted for this particular purpose and its performance is investigated by running the agents of the swarm intelligence algorithm on sample mammographs whose status have been determined by the experts. Two modes of the algorithms are introduced in the paper, each providing the clinicians with a different set of outputs, highlighting the areas of interest where more attention should be given by those in charge of the care of the patients.</td>\n      <td>Dispersive flies optimisation | Mammographs | Medical imaging | Multi-agent algorithm</td>\n      <td>12</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>repositoryam</td>\n      <td>Green</td>\n      <td>None</td>\n      <td>undefined</td>\n      <td>None</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2337</th>\n      <td>2-s2.0-77951133759</td>\n      <td>10.1201/9781420069273-26</td>\n      <td>None</td>\n      <td>None</td>\n      <td>Uncertainty, Vagueness, and Indiscernibility: The Impact of Spatial Scale in Relation to the Landscape Elements</td>\n      <td>ch</td>\n      <td>Book Chapter</td>\n      <td>Comber A.J.</td>\n      <td>60033125;60027514;60025704</td>\n      <td>University of Leicester;Natural Resources Wales;City, University of London</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>239-250</td>\n      <td>Countryside agencies such as the Countryside Council for Wales (CCW) are responsible for reporting on and monitoring the rural environment.
